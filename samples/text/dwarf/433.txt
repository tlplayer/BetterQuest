"As a member of the Senate and the Explorers' League, I've taken it upon myself to take care of this part of the trogg infestation that has gripped our lands. They've certainly made a mess of Gol'Bolar quarry, and for no reason. As we dug deep into the earth, they poured out, destroying our equipment and driving the miners out. There's not much for us to do but to exterminate the lot of them, rebuild, then get back to work. If you help me with the troggs, I'll gladly recompense you for your time."
