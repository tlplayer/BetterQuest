He won't be ""collecting"" from the Elwynn Mines again!$B$BAnd this ring you found is interesting... it's a membership ring for the old Stonemason's Guild in Stormwind. Why would a lowly thief have an artisan guild ring, and why are the Defias Thieves collecting money from our mines?$B$BDifficult questions. I hope one day we'll have answers."
240,Marshal Dughan,,0,1985,quest_complete,176,"Hah! Well done! I was starting to think no one would take down that monster!$B$BHere you are, $N. And thanks - that Gnoll was giving me a headache the size of Blackrock Spire!"

A wandering undead calling itself Mor'Ladim has been wandering Duskwood. From what we've gathered, it appears to be the undead body of Morgan Ladimore, of whom you apparently know. He's been causing us all sorts of problems, attacking Watchmen on patrol and killing people.$B$B<She sizes you up.>$B$BYou seem to be capable enough, maybe you could lay him to rest."

267,Clerk Daltry,,0,1720,quest_complete,66,Ah so Madame Eva sent you....
267,Clerk Daltry,,0,1720,quest_complete,68,"Interesting. So the chap did spend some time in Moonbrook after all. It is rather odd the letter never got delivered. Nonetheless, I shall update the registry."
267,Clerk Daltry,,0,1720,quest_complete,80,Why yes! The writing on this page does in fact match that of the registry signatures.
267,Clerk Daltry,,0,1720,quest_complete,265,"Ah, yes. I sold this book a month ago to a shady person. He didn't tell me his name, but he was a nervous, jittery chap, always looking over his shoulder.$B$BI hope that helps you..."
267,Clerk Daltry,,0,1720,quest_complete,1041,"With all the strange happenings of the last few years, I keep as good records of strangers as I can.

Not only have you given the families of the dead the peace of mind they deserve, you sent a poignant message to those corrupt bureaucrats in the House of Nobles. Stormwind must rise to the needs of the people of Duskwood or we will break free from their tyranny."

273,Tavernkeep Smitts,,0,1731,quest_complete,266,"Oh yeah, I remember this book.

279,Morgan Pestle,,0,5082,quest_complete,9024,"I understand Aristan's concerns, but I really think he's overreacting. Let young men and women do what they will. I think Aristan has forgotten what it means to be young and in love.$B$BBut it would be better not to tell him that. We'll humor him."
288,Jitters,,0,4325,quest_complete,163,No! Please don't kill me! It's just me... Jitters!! They're everywhere... I can't escape them! Monsters in Raven Hill? N-n-n-o... couldn't be. Only harmless Jitters.

289,Abercrombie,,0,4328,quest_complete,165,"Hehe, oh yes... of course, the Carevins.$B$BNo, nothing's wrong but it is hard for me to go into town now. The roads are dangerous and I'm not getting any younger. Maybe you can do an old man some favors?"

I'm glad to see you're already learning to use your abilities wisely. If you feel you are ready for more training at any time, please come back to me. But for now, take this robe. It will let others know that you are one of our order. If you don't want to wear it, that's fine. Later there will be more tests and this robe isn't necessary for those."

I can train you in the beginnings of those special powers. Seek me out often and I will do what I can to teach you more spells."
464,Guard Parker,,0,2150,quest_complete,129,"Thanks, I could really use the meal. Guarding Lakeshire from the orcs and gnolls is tough work!"

469,Lieutenant Doren,,0,2593,quest_complete,215,"Yes, what Thorsen told you is true. You must be discrete with this. At one time, we rebels were fiercely loyal to Colonel Kurzen.

If it was made known that Private Thorsen has had recent dealings with Kurzen's men, then one night he would find himself with a slit throat.$B$BTo my knowledge, only Sergeant Yohwa, Thorsen and I were privy to Thorsen's mission.

469,Lieutenant Doren,,0,2593,quest_complete,331,"It pains me to find out it was Merle who betrayed us. He has always been a brave soldier, and I had thought his heart was true.

469,Lieutenant Doren,,0,2593,quest_complete,574,"$N. Sergeant Yohwa trusted your abilities, and I trust her. The defeat you brought to Kurzen's forces is almost too much to hope for.

Interesting.$B$BThe Scourge aren't content with one continent it seems.

I trust the elementals from which you removed these bracers were amenable?$B$BHm...death has not only stopped my heart, but robbed me of my comedic timing, it seems.$B$BWell thank you, $N.

2495,Drizzlik,,0,7166,quest_complete,575,"These skins should do. Their quality isn't too important, given that they'll make up the inside layer of the boots, but it's still important that they're comfortable.$B$BIf they're a bit too rigid, I'll use some tiger blood to soften it up. Tricks o' the trade, you know?"
2495,Drizzlik,,0,7166,quest_complete,577,"My boots... they're like sausages, $N. Look great, taste great.

2496,Baron Revilgaz,,0,7167,quest_complete,1181,"Oh, sure of course I know what you're talking about. Nope, can't help you though. Some of my men were supposed to go track down the blueprints for the fuel regulator, but they came back empty-handed."

Everything seemed normal--well, as normal as things get around here--and then suddenly there was a blinding flash of light from the upper room of the tower. Then came the screams. The cries split the air, and lightning struck the ground from time to time. What's going on?"

I suppose Balthule wanted to be certain that his letter reached my hands. Let's see what he has to say...$B$BThis is disturbing news. When undead or demonic forces are found, I help the Sentinels destroy them.$B$BAt first I was unaccustomed to the manners of the night elves, but I have grown to respect them greatly as allies."
3663,Delgren the Purifier,,0,2531,quest_complete,970,"Hmm, some dark magic enchants this soulstone. Let's see what's trapped inside, shall we?"

3663,Delgren the Purifier,,0,2531,quest_complete,1140,"Perhaps the satyrs have been allowed to persist in the forest for too long. I will speak with Elissa about it when next I travel to Auberdine.$B$BNonetheless, with the soulgems destroyed, Athrikus' power will be greatly diminished.

I shall send some of the Sentinels to recover Teronis' body as soon as possible.$B$BYou have Teronis' journal and the gem he was seeking. Do you think you're capable of completing his task? I would rest much better knowing his death was not in vain."

I shall set to work on the cloak immediately.$B$BGive me a few moments, then return to me.$B$BOh, one more thing: after you've used the enchantment on the cloak you'll be limited in your interactions with others. If you can help it, do no more than speak to others. Much more than that could dispel the illusion."
3693,Terenthis,,0,1956,quest_complete,994,$N! I'm pleased to see you've returned successfully. Your assistance to Volcor has given me faith that we can overcome the challenges facing us here in Darkshore and beyond.

No wonder the deer are sick.$B$BSomething is polluting the water, and in turn corrupting Darkshore's entire water table. Sick deer have been seen all over area, and not just by the river. While this water is most likely a primary source of the sickness spreading, there's something else at work here.$B$BThis water, believe it or not, will help us formulate a cure.

3706,Tai'jin,,1,1897,quest_complete,5648,"Good, then Kor'ja lives and goes off to defend our town from those malicious humans.

Your actions in the Zoram Strand against the naga are commendable.$B$BI know your feat was not easily accomplished, for the strength and guile of the naga is well known to the night elves.

The creatures within these containment coffers will be studied by our finest minds, and the reason behind their presence in the Undercity will be determined.$B$BIf their appearance is caused by a rift in the natural flow of magic, then we must determine if the rift was random.

4926,Krog,,0,2972,quest_complete,1268,"Hoofprints... It could have been the quilboar, I suppose. Or maybe even the centaur. Their presence in the Barrens is not insignificant, and I would not think it a stretch to commit such an act.$B$BDid I tell you? It wasn't just that the inn was burned down... The owner's woman and pup were killed. Bad business, that.$B$BNonetheless, I will send Kagoro to find where the tracks lead."
4926,Krog,,0,2972,quest_complete,1269,"I know this human, Paval Reethe. Pathetic, even for his kind. He deserted his fellow soldiers and is now hiding out in the woods.$B$BI sent Ogron out to track him down. Some of the others suspect he's been stealing from our supplies.

4926,Krog,,0,2972,quest_complete,1273,"Hmph. It is good that Reethe will no longer be lurking around the swamp, but it is a shame that humans are built so frail that he could not recover from a little arrow wound.$B$BIt seems that this thread of the mystery has led nowhere, and we must look elsewhere."
4926,Krog,,0,2972,quest_complete,1323,Mosarn? Sounds familiar... I can't put my finger on it. Maybe it'll come to me later.$B$BIt probably isn't important. A shield can come from anywhere and not mean anything...

4944,Captain Garran Vimes,,0,2952,quest_complete,1253,"Hm, I'm no expert with the construction of arms and armor. Their use, yes, but not their making.$B$BThis shield seems as ordinary as any, excepting the damage from the fire that engulfed the inn."

Wanted to make a nice place for travelers to stop over...$B$BMight be he was thinking too big, but the inn did do well for a while. Then we lost control of the roads in the marsh, and the ogres took over.$B$BJames was too stubborn to give up his dream for safety within our walls, and the Shady Rest Inn was burnt to the ground. We're investigating, but haven't had much luck. If you want to help out, see what you can find in the rubble."
4944,Captain Garran Vimes,,0,2952,quest_complete,1284,"Hoofprints, eh? It is true that there is an extraordinary amount of centaur activity in the lands near the Dustwallow Marsh.

4944,Captain Garran Vimes,,0,2952,quest_complete,1285,Missing? That would be Tesoran's kind way of saying traitor.$B$BNo doubt he's one of those fools so blindly loyal to Admiral Daelin that he turned traitor. Isn't that a delicious irony? The deserters accuse us of betraying the Alliance.
4944,Captain Garran Vimes,,0,2952,quest_complete,1287,"I will send Lieutenant Caldwell to deal with the deserters at Lost Point. In addition, I will instruct him to find Reethe. The marsh is not so big and trackless that he should be unable to find him."
4944,Captain Garran Vimes,,0,2952,quest_complete,1320,"That's not much information to work on, but we'll have to keep it in mind. Hopefully some of the other pieces of this mystery will fall into place, and paint a more helpful picture of what happened."

Who would suspect someone so young and so brave would rise up and champion our cause? You remind me of myself when I was younger. I will ensure that you are justly rewarded for your efforts if we both survive the coming storm.$B$BBut there is time for more praise later.

4949,Thrall,,0,4527,quest_complete,5728,"I am glad you've returned, $N. Some of those loyal to me brought word immediately that the caverns below Orgrimmar were in disarray now that their leaders have been slain. I even heard reports that Neeru was more than agitated. It seems we've put a dent in his armor. I can't say I'm displeased... even with such a minor victory."
4949,Thrall,,0,4527,quest_complete,5730,"Ashenvale? Hmm, I had not heard of any presence of the Council or the Burning Blade in Ashenvale. My spies will investigate, $N.

4949,Thrall,,0,4527,quest_complete,8485,"Indeed, this is a most fortuitous turn of events. Were a lasting peace to be made with these creatures, this would certainly give us an advantage in securing Kalimdor from external threats. I will notify the other leaders of the Horde of this immediately, and further diplomats will be dispatched!$B$BAs for you, $N... you have shown courage in both diplomacy and in action.

I'm surprised that was Slim.$B$BI'll be honest, I never thought I'd miss the excitement of some of the more devious underground activities. I guess old habits die hard. Don't mention that to Elling--he'd probably try and get me to come back to Stormwind if he heard I missed the action.$B$BI'm glad I could at least be of a little service to you while you were in Menethil.

I didn't even hear he was missing--that would explain his son being crowned some.$B$BI'll send word to Elling right away. He'll want to know you're on the trail.$B$BI would never have guessed Jahn would sell out Stormwind for some lousy coin. Even a rogue's got to have honor when it comes to some things.$B$BThe key now is to find this Hendel. And I think I can help with that.

I wouldn't hang around too long if you value your life.$B$BIf you keep your questions short, I'll see if I can help you. Just keep your eyes open for any of those filthy ogres. Rumor has it there's a Horde base somewhere in the swamps. The infiltrators are doing what they can to find it, but the process has been slow going and we've had little progress."

5082,Vincent Hyal,,0,3011,quest_complete,1301,"James? Oh, he left quite some time ago.$B$BFelt the second wind of patriotism, I suppose. Not hard to see why he would. With all the insanity in Lordaeron, many people joined up with Jaina Proudmoore when she went across the sea."
5083,Clerk Lendry,,0,3014,quest_complete,1302,"James Hyal, James Hyal... Why does that name sound so familiar?$B$BOf course! The Shady Rest Inn incident. If you have any information about what happened there, I would urge you to speak with Captain Vimes about it. He's handling the investigation."
5087,Do'gol,,2,655,quest_complete,1321,"This is good shield. Very strong, heavy, good. But Do'gol don't need it. I make shields, not buy them, $n.$B$BYou should know that."

5397,Uthek the Wise,,2,4875,quest_complete,1374,"Khan Jehn was strong, but stupid. He thought his own strength was great. He did not see that earth magic is stronger. The Magram centaur will now fall without their leader, and the Gelkis will one day rule!"

5476,Watcher Biggs,,0,3252,quest_complete,1421,"Ah, you found them! With these, the wizards in Nethergarde may continue their work. I do not know what it is that they do, but it is linked to the Dark Portal in the Blasted Lands, and is vital to the security of the Alliance."

I can tell you right from the start though... these are nothing like any insect form I have ever seen.

5636,Gryphon Master Talonaxe,,0,7007,quest_complete,2988,Sharpbeak wasn't at the villages?  Hm... this is grim news.  That gryphon is destined to lead the next generation of gryphons.  If he is lost then the strength and spirit of our fleet will suffer immensely.
5636,Gryphon Master Talonaxe,,0,7007,quest_complete,2989,"Sharpbeak wasn't there?  That is bad news, but it is good news too...$B$BIt is good that he was not at the Altar of Zul for the Vilebranch trolls are known for performing sacrifices.$B$BI thank you for all of your aid, but I'm afraid I have an even greater task ahead."
5636,Gryphon Master Talonaxe,,0,7007,quest_complete,2993,You've spoken with Grimshade?  What did he say?$B$B...What?  The Vilebranch trolls have Sharpbeak?  That's unbearable!  We must organize a force to get him back!
5636,Gryphon Master Talonaxe,,0,7007,quest_complete,2994,"Swiftwind and Keenclaw returned with their child moments ago, and are fussing over him like new parents.  Seeing them together again is enough to give even this old dwarf mist in the eyes...$B$BWe cannot repay you enough for what you have done, $N.  The gryphons of Aerie peak, and their riders, will sing your name for a long, long time."
5637,Roetten Stonehammer,,0,3756,quest_complete,1457,"Ah, the Karnitol business in Desolace. Excellent!$B$BSo, the chest was destroyed, but the items are all here, huh? Well, I'll let him be the judge of that. One good part about this business I got going on here is that if they're not satisfied, I can tell 'em to shove it! They're relyin' on us to find their stuff... not make sure it's all pretty and in good shape when they get it back.$B$BGood work, $N. Let's see about gettin' you paid."
5637,Roetten Stonehammer,,0,3756,quest_complete,1467,"Ah, the package for Leftwitch from Desolace. Excellent. I 'preciate the work, and your timeliness, $C.

5638,Kreldig Ungor,,0,3757,quest_complete,1453,"Glad to see the Reclaimers aren't in short supply of work, or adventurers willing to help out.$B$BI'm Kreldig, $N. You've made a smart move helpin' out the Reclaimers. Everyone needs something these days: they've lost a family heirloom, a magic item, a loved one. You never can tell. But with the Reclaimers around, there's no reason, for the right price, everyone can't find what they've lost."
5638,Kreldig Ungor,,0,3757,quest_complete,1455,"Welcome back to Nijel's Point, $N. So, tell me what you found.$B$BWhat!? Nothing? An empty chest ain't gonna get us paid, I'm afraid.$B$BTell me more about these marks you saw... these slashes."
5638,Kreldig Ungor,,0,3757,quest_complete,1456,"This is great, $N! You found Karnitol's belongings!$B$BThose blasted naga, always causing trouble. I think I'd rather spend my life at war with the Horde than have to go against their kind. You've done a great service to the Reclaimers."
5638,Kreldig Ungor,,0,3757,quest_complete,1458,"Good good, $N. Not sure if these are of any good quality, but if Leftwitch wanted a specific type, he should have specified before sending the Reclaimers out here to begin with.$B$BWhat say you to getting on with the next item on his list?"
5638,Kreldig Ungor,,0,3757,quest_complete,1459,"Your help here's a boon, $N. You're cutting my time spent here in Desolace by half at least. I'll be back in Ironforge warming my feet in no time with your help.$B$BWhen we get this list taken care of, and I'm back home, look me up, I'll buy you an ale for sure.$B$BBut until then, let's get the rest of these reagents gathered."
5638,Kreldig Ungor,,0,3757,quest_complete,1466,"Honestly? I wouldn't have thought it. You're amazing, $N. Taking on demons for a mage's experiments, and coming back in one piece to boot. Great job!$B$BI'm personally gonna tell Roetten about you when I get back to Ironforge."

I am Keldran, student of magic... and other mystical arts.$B$BThe business Craven sent you here to speak to me about requires a touch more subtlety than you've previously needed, but that does not mean you can not still aid our cause.$B$BPlease, make yourself comfortable, and I shall tell you why the Warchief has need of my aid... and yours.$B$BIt starts with appearances, $N. How the Horde sees itself. How our allies see us. And most importantly, how our enemies see us."
5640,Keldran,,0,3759,quest_complete,1436,"You have returned from Desolace more than successful, $N. Thank you.$B$BThank you for your efforts, your time, and your understanding to my plea. Thrall understands and desires peace between the Horde and Alliance, and by taking measures to insure our appearance is acceptable, we will not provoke any further threats of unnecessary violence.$B$BI am indebted to you."
5641,Takata Steelblade,,0,3760,quest_complete,1432,"Greetings, $C. You bring news from Orgrimmar; that is good.$B$BThe demon infestation overwhelms this area even more than the smell of centaur dung. The horse-men claim this land as their own, but clearly there are influences out of their control that will crush them if not kept in check.$B$BIt does not please me that we aid the centaur indirectly, but it is for the good of the Horde, so I do my duty for the Warchief, even if it means helping the warlocks within the Horde."
5641,Takata Steelblade,,0,3760,quest_complete,1434,"You have done well, $c. You have shown honor and dedication.$B$BWhen our campaign in Desolace is done, the Warchief will know that you aided us in our actions here, and that you helped make his will manifest.$B$BI thank you."
5641,Takata Steelblade,,0,3760,quest_complete,1484,"I witnessed what just occurred with Maurin and the demon lord. That creature, even as an apparition, seems to have more power than my warlock companion. I wonder if he's up to the task of defeating the monster? It would serve the Warchief better if I go myself, but with my responsibilities here, I would disgrace my clan if I turned my back on my duties here to battle this evil for my own honor."
5641,Takata Steelblade,,0,3760,quest_complete,1488,"A mighty victory for us all, $N. Let us rejoice in your success. I trust now that our future here is not as bleak as I once thought.$B$BThe demons will be slain, the Burning Blade will fail in their efforts, and we may one day have a place we can safely call home again."
5642,Vahlarriel Demonslayer,,0,3789,quest_complete,1440,"Thank you, $N. Dalinda made it safely back here to Nijel's Point, and in much better condition than I could have asked for. The fact that she arrived here under her own power was a good sign. I hope you're well?$B$BIt pains me to know that both Tyranis and Dalinda didn't return, but the embarrassment of Tyranis' decisions is hers to endure. It is something she will have to deal with when she returns to Darnassus."
5642,Vahlarriel Demonslayer,,0,3789,quest_complete,1465,"Infuriating! This entire fiasco!$B$BThe two of them were warned about how dangerous coming here would be. Now they're both missing... or worse.$B$BYou said you saw tracks heading to a fort nearby? That may be our best bet.$B$BFrom what the locals have said, that fortress is infested with members of the Burning Blade--orcs who have dedicated themselves to demon causes. They may not represent the majority of the Horde's beliefs, but they are evil and will slay you on sight if you're caught spying."
5644,Dalinda Malem,,1,3791,quest_complete,1438,"Thank Elune someone has finally come to help. Please, $C, I need your help. My brother Tyranis and I were captured and brought here by the Burning Blade. I think they mean to sacrifice me to their demon masters!$B$BI knew coming to Desolace was a mistake, but Tyranis has recently begun craving knowledge of all things arcane--even against the wishes of our people. He decided to make this trek even after hearing tales of this land's demon infestation.$B$BI fear the worst for him."
5644,Dalinda Malem,,1,3791,quest_complete,1439,"This is terrible! But I suppose it was necessary. If it wasn't by your hand, it would have surely been by that of my people's. I suppose I should thank you--please forgive me if it doesn't seem sincere. I mean no offense.$B$BWith the knowledge of my brother's fate in hand, it seems the time for my escape has come. If you are still willing, I will accept your aid in escaping this horrible place.$B$BWhen you are ready, we can make our way to safety."
5651,Patrick Garrett,,0,6228,quest_complete,2342,"At last - a broom worthy of a Garrett.  You're bloody well worth every silver I spent on you, I say!$B$BDo you hear me, foul bats?  I now wield the Garrett family weapon of choice!  Tremble, bats, tremble!!"
5667,Venya Marthand,,1,3944,quest_complete,1470,"Though you are still untested and young in your learning, you have proven that you possess sufficient ability to master the summoning and binding of an imp. Do not be deceived by an imp's size. Though it lacks physical strength, it possesses powers and a cleverness that will serve you well.$B$BAttend me carefully, $N, for I will not repeat this lesson, and I will leave its mastery to you."
5675,Carendin Halgar,,0,3948,quest_complete,1471,"You have done well, $N. Now, I will impart to you the spell used for summoning the voidwalker.$B$BThe power that it unleashed upon you is now yours to command. Use it wisely."
5675,Carendin Halgar,,0,3948,quest_complete,1473,"Ah, this is excellent. Like as not, Perrine was ignorant to the true power of the musty book he had stolen from us.$B$BIt will not fall out of our hands again. Observe, $N, the structure of the spell, the manner in which your power must be channeled."
5675,Carendin Halgar,,0,3948,quest_complete,1474,"Again, you have done well, $N. It has been quite some time since I have seen a young warlock with as much potential as you. Be assured that I will continue to watch your progress, and prepare and assist you in your future trials.$B$BFor now, let me show you the summoning spell for your newly dominated succubus."
5675,Carendin Halgar,,0,3948,quest_complete,1476,"The heart of a goodly man seems much the same as any, when you see it like this, don't you think?$B$BPerhaps we possess something of a... different... view on the subject. These will do, though. I have no doubt that a succubus would be attracted by their purity."
5675,Carendin Halgar,,0,3948,quest_complete,1478,"Good, I see Ageron managed to find you, $N. Let us waste little time with small talk and pleasantries and focus on your training. There is still much you have to learn."
5688,Innkeeper Renee,,1,8190,quest_complete,8,"Oh? A letter? Wonderful news! I've been waiting on word from my dear old mother in Deathknell. Such a saint, she is. I wonder how she's holding up.$B$BWhat? Too cheery? Not buying it, are you?$B$BWell, get lost then... it's really no business who the letter's from anyway. Go on! Get lost!$B$BCome back when you've got some coin to spend... loafer.$B$BNext thing you know, you'll be coming back to rest after a long days adventure or some stupid thing like that."

5752,Corporal Melkins,,0,4692,quest_complete,1387,"Ah, the ears. Well done.$B$BYour service to the Alliance is unquestioned, $N. The blood you spilled in Desolace will, no doubt, save countless lives."
5765,Ruzan,,0,4209,quest_complete,1485,"Throughout your training as a warlock, you will learn to call forth beings of many sorts. Some may not seem it, but all are useful tools.$B$BDo not be fooled by the imp's small size. As you no doubt noticed, it is still a formidable adversary."

5895,Minor Manifestation of Water,,2,525,quest_complete,100,Thanks to you. Thanks to the shamans.$B$BCorruption ebbs but life continues to wane. Up to shamans to protect life.
5899,Brine,,1,4536,quest_complete,1530,"Yes?$B$BMmm. I have a feeling I know what you're going to ask me: what would possess someone to live out here in the deepest part of the Barrens, the threat of quilboar all around, and no protection? Well, we all have our reasons to justify why we act the way we do. The real question is, what brings a lowly $R to the deepest reaches of the Barrens to speak to a woman who obviously has no concern for her own well-being?$B$BI'm willing to bet we both know the answer to that."
5899,Brine,,1,4536,quest_complete,1534,"Wonderful, $N. With all three samples gathered, I can create for you a vial of the purest water any living creature will find.

5899,Brine,,1,4536,quest_complete,1535,"I thought some bloodshed might ensue if you tried to take water from the pool. It is a pity the quilboar do not realize that all living things are tied together; that their greed only perpetuates the pain and suffering of their people. How much could they accomplish if they were to put their differences aside and their clans came together.$B$BAgain, a pity, but more than likely a boon for the other races of the Barrens."

I am pleased to make your acquaintance.$B$BMany adventurers find their way here while looking for lost treasure or the promise of mystical creatures to slay, only to be turned away from a seemingly empty shrine. But we know the truth, do we not, $N?$B$BThis shrine holds a greater secret from the mundane members of the Horde. To us, it is sacred."
5900,Telf Joolam,,0,4537,quest_complete,1525,"These will do nicely, $N.$B$BFire is more than chaos and destruction--do well to remember that. It is also about life, and creation. All things are tied together in such a way. Forces oppose one another, but at the same time, one cannot exist without the other. Both extinguish one another, but also give one another meaning. Always remember this.$B$BUsing different types of magic in conjunction with one another will show not only true skill, but great wisdom."

6175,John Turner,,0,4889,quest_complete,1648,"This is so wonderful of you, $N. Thank you again.$B$BYou're a noble man for doing this for me. It's no wonder you've chosen to follow the Light. I wish there was some way I could repay you for all you've done... what's that? It's the least you could do? See? That's what I'm talking about, $N, noble to the end.$B$BBe safe, and may the Light protect you in your travels."
6176,Bath'rah the Windwatcher,,0,4954,quest_complete,1712,"You have gathered the items for my spell, and have shown me your strength and cunning. But the next stage of our quest is even more perilous.$B$BLet us hope your strength does not falter."
6176,Bath'rah the Windwatcher,,0,4954,quest_complete,1713,You did it! You defeated Cyclonian and gained the Whirlwind Heart!
6176,Bath'rah the Windwatcher,,0,4954,quest_complete,1791,"You have traveled far, young warrior.  I see fire in your eyes.  You seek a weapon of great power, yes?$B$BI can help you with your quest.  And you can help me with mine."

6176,Bath'rah the Windwatcher,,0,4954,quest_complete,8411,These be the elements I need. Now we talk.

6177,Narm Faulk,,0,4890,quest_complete,1783,"I can't thank you enough, $gbrother:sister;.$B$BI can only assume that Tiza and Muiredon sent you here to aid me if you carry the Symbol of Life.$B$BIt's true, I fell to the Dark Iron while trying to attain one of the scripts: I was able to hold on long enough to allow Muiredon to escape, but the Light had almost embraced me fully when you came along. The fact that you were powerful enough to use the Symbol means great things for you, but there's time to speak of that later."
6178,Muiredon Battleforge,,0,4891,quest_complete,1779,"*cough*$B$BGood day to ya, $C. Don't mind me wounds, the good priest 'ere'll take care of ol' Muiredon in time.

I'll take the time to talk to ya-I'll tell ya exactly wut happened to Muiredon and his best friend Narm, a $C jus' like yerself."
6178,Muiredon Battleforge,,0,4891,quest_complete,1784,"Haha! You've done it! Ya saved Narm, and ya found the proof me wife needs to take to the council. Yer a blessin' o' the Light if I ever saw one... not includin' me wife o' course.$B$BThank ya again, $N."

If you accept it, I will give you a Book of Divinity. In studying it, you shall learn some about the Light, and what is expected of you. If you understand it, and are capable, then you will succeed in attaining greater abilities."
6179,Tiza Battleforge,,1,4892,quest_complete,1646,"Welcome back, $N. You've spent time reading the book, I hope?$B$BThen you should be prepared to have yourself tested. There are always tasks to be done throughout the city and our lands; acts of compassion and understanding; people who need help; creatures to slay.$B$BBy proving you have the patience to help others, especially those who are less fortunate, you prove that you are a servant of the Light and of sound mind."
6179,Tiza Battleforge,,1,4892,quest_complete,1778,"So, you've returned so quickly, huh? And what pray tell have you accomplished in your time away from here?$B$BWere you able to help a noble cause? Perhaps you've learned the value of charity or some more about your obligations to the citizens of Azeroth. Tell me, who have you helped and how.... Impressive, $N, those are surely the actions of one who follows the Light.$B$BSuch sacrifice will always be rewarded in time."
6179,Tiza Battleforge,,1,4892,quest_complete,1785,"You've done all of Ironforge a great favor today, $N. I'm proud to count you among us, and if you feel you're ready, I would like to bless you with this scroll. The Symbol of Life would only have worked when used by a $C who was ready for one of the Light's greatest blessings-the power to restore the dead back to life.$B$BI will teach you the ability to resurrect your companions. Use it wisely, $N, and thank you, on behalf of myself, my husband, and Ironforge."

I knew there was going to be trouble if I left.$B$BPlease tell me she's... oh, thank goodness. I'm so glad that she's safe. The Defias were a threat long before these attacks, but now the King's advisors cannot deny it.$B$BWhat else did Duthorian have to say? You're the one that was sent to protect my wife? Then I thank you again, $N. I couldn't think of a better test of valor than that."
6181,Jordan Stilwell,,0,4893,quest_complete,1654,"This is wonderful! You've gotten all the items.$B$BI should have no problem forging you a grand weapon with these. I've actually had the plans for doing this for some time. I just never had the opportunity to gather the goods. Thank you, $N.$B$BIt feels good to have my father's hammer again...and a Kor gem. I never thought I'd see one of these myself."
6181,Jordan Stilwell,,0,4893,quest_complete,1806,"Here it is, $N. A weapon worthy of a champion of the Light such as yourself. I've named it after a great dwarven paladin who was a friend of mine. His name was Verigan... Bosch Verigan.$B$BPlease take it on behalf of myself and my wife. We owe you a great debt, and the world will be a safer place with one of your skill traveling the land."
6182,Daphne Stilwell,,1,4894,quest_complete,1650,"Hello, $N. I'm assuming by all that armor and weapon of yours, you're either here to try and take my land, or the Church finally sent someone to help protect me while my Jordan's gone.$B$B Well, let me introduce myself: I'm Daphne Stilwell. It's a pleasure.$B$BNow, you're not too late... I've only killed a half dozen of the scum since last sun up. They've been a little slow getting 'round the bend up there, but they probably saw you coming, which means they'll probably be here any minute."
6182,Daphne Stilwell,,1,4894,quest_complete,1651,"We've done it, $N! Thank you for your help. You were truly amazing out there. I never thought a $C could handle so many enemies at once.$B$BYou've truly shown bravery in the face of overwhelming odds."

6244,Takar the Seer,,0,4928,quest_complete,1716,"Was your crossing difficult, $N? You have come a long way to speak with me. But fear not, I know why Gakin has sent you, and he was wise to, for I can help you in your search."
6247,Doan Karhan,,0,4931,quest_complete,1740,"Yes... The orb was not greatly fragmented, and almost all of the pieces are here. It is a simple thing to recreate them, to make Soran'ruk whole again.$B$BI have dedicated my life to the study of the Burning Legion's orbs and their recreation.

6251,Strahad Farsan,,0,4940,quest_complete,1795,"I must say I'm impressed, $N. When I faced down my felhunter, I barely escaped with my life. I sense that you have the potential to become one of the most powerful warlocks of this era."
6251,Strahad Farsan,,0,4940,quest_complete,1798,"$N? Ah, of course. Our latest prodigy. The real thing can not live up to the legend, I am afraid. $B$BNo matter, you have come here to learn, not to hear me make jokes to myself."
6251,Strahad Farsan,,0,4940,quest_complete,1804,"Well done! The Tome of the Cabal and three pristine--slightly scratched, I suppose--rods of channeling.$B$BThis will be interesting. It's been some time since a young warlock took on a felhunter to make his own."

6266,Menara Voidrender,,1,4948,quest_complete,1796,"This will do nicely, $N.$B$BAll magical items must begin with an item of high quality. The more effort and skill put into an item, the greater the magics it can hold. Rare and more expensive components hold the magic better.

6266,Menara Voidrender,,1,4948,quest_complete,4736,"Ah, Briarthorn sent you. Good. Then word does reach far enough to find future students.

6266,Menara Voidrender,,1,4948,quest_complete,4782,"Good, you've returned, $N. And where is the thread?$B$BAh, I understand. That is acceptable. The goblin and his brother have not failed us yet--I suppose it is understandable that he did not have it prepared right then.

6266,Menara Voidrender,,1,4948,quest_complete,4783,"Excellent, $N. These will do nicely. I will prepare them now while you move on to your last two components. Are you ready?"

6294,Krom Stoutarm,,0,4988,quest_complete,1360,"Ah, I feel complete again - thank you kindly.$B$BSome dwarves may treasure the luster of metal, and some may treasure the glint of gems... but a Stoutarm without a treasured stein in hand is hardly a Stoutarm at all!"

I lost my sense of humor the same time I lost my sense of smell. Which was about the same time I stopped breathing."
6411,Velora Nitely,,1,5235,quest_complete,1846,"Well done! These all look strong. I think they'll do quite nicely. How did those orcs mind you taking their shins, $N? Complain much?$B$BThat was another joke. You're not laughing.$B$BI'm not very funny these days, am I..."
6411,Velora Nitely,,1,5235,quest_complete,1847,"Here are your legguards, $N. Let me know how they fit or if you need any modifications. I aim to please! At least I used to.$B$BThese days I don't care much for my craft. But it beats being a mindless minion of the Scourge!$B$BI guess."
6446,Therzok,,0,5190,quest_complete,1858,"Hmmm, now this is interesting. You've more than proved your worth with this, $N. I am quite impressed. Consider yourself the newest member of the Shattered Hand. And take this, it will be a great help to you in the future, I think."
6446,Therzok,,0,5190,quest_complete,1859,"Very good, I'm glad Kaplak was able to get a hold of you.$B$BWe have some things to speak of, not the least of which is your future with the Hand."
6446,Therzok,,0,5190,quest_complete,1963,"Hm, while I am glad to hear that Tazan is no longer with us, a locked satchel does us no good. We need the information kept within.$B$BThis should prove a worthy second challenge for one who wishes to join the Shattered Hand."
6467,Mennet Carkad,,0,5206,quest_complete,1885,"Hm. No doubt you made your way here at first mention of my summons, yes? Of course. I would expect no less from a prospective Deathstalker."
6467,Mennet Carkad,,0,5206,quest_complete,1886,"Well done, $N. You've passed the first part of this test. Hopefully Andron will not have caught wind of your activities, and we will be able to convince him that you are, in fact, the messenger he is expecting."
6467,Mennet Carkad,,0,5206,quest_complete,1899,"Well, this is certainly more information than I suspected to get out of Andron. Give me a moment to peruse it, before I set you to your next task."
6467,Mennet Carkad,,0,5206,quest_complete,1998,"You've done well, $N. It occurs to me that you have performed many services for the Deathstalkers, proving your worth, and that perhaps it is time that we furthered your training in the shadow arts."
6467,Mennet Carkad,,0,5206,quest_complete,1999,"Very good, $N! You have learned the fine art of lockpicking well, and faster than I could have possibly expected.$B$BI see that I was right to place my trust in you. Believe me, boy, I foresee that you will go far in this line of work."
6522,Andron Gant,,0,5346,quest_complete,1898,"Ah, yes, I've been expecting you. I have no doubt our mutual acquaintances are pleased with the information that I have provided so far?$B$BI suppose there's no point in asking you, I doubt they would burden you with this knowledge. Why place so much trust in the messenger, hm?"
6522,Andron Gant,,0,5346,quest_complete,3542,"Here, take some coin... get yerself... <hic>... some new armor or something....$B$BThis'll bring a shiny gold or two to the right... <hic> people."
6546,Tabetha,,1,5375,quest_complete,1799,"Oh, so Menara sent you. Fair enough... I suppose you may stay as my guest for the time being. But you must be on some pressing business - perhaps you're here seeking lost power? Maybe I'm mistaken. Maybe corruption isn't too far away from you after all."
6546,Tabetha,,1,5375,quest_complete,1947,Quiet! I'm in a delicate juncture and mustn't be disturbed!$B$BOne moment...

6546,Tabetha,,1,5375,quest_complete,1951,That's it!  It's just what I need to prepare for the ritual to create your wand!  I hope it wasn't too much trouble to find...

Let me start by putting down facts so they don't slip my mind at a later date.

I've recently found truth to the rumors of the wizard Dartol's efforts."
item_5505,Teronis' Journal,,,,item_text,0,"Where once I thought it preposterous that a human would come to our lands and learn our ways, this wizard, this evil man, came here and not only survived, but also gained some of our knowledge. I'm still uncertain how...

I never discovered his goals during my investigation, but his plan seemed simple: using druidic magic, he wanted to befriend and then control the furbolg. If it was in an attempt to harm my kin, or for some other malicious purpose, I hope to find out before my path ends."
item_5505,Teronis' Journal,,,,item_text,0,"Regardless, he was apparently more successful than naught in actualizing his plans. Did he want to attempt his machinations on the furbolg before trying on my people? Did the furbolg have something he coveted? Who knows?

item_5505,Teronis' Journal,,,,item_text,0,"one another. As I'm sure the elves would be, the furbolg were angered, but they reacted much more strongly and killed Dartol.

The furbolg, at least at this time, weren't the same corrupted creatures they've become. They were still rational and intelligent--their relationship with our people amicable.

I'm hoping that if I can recreate the rod with the help of a dryad named Shael'dryn, I can use its power to help our people... and the furbolg."
item_5505,Teronis' Journal,,,,item_text,0,"Not all the furbolg have been corrupted. Some still live and try to protect the forest. During their corruption, some of the furbolg fled, many were killed, and others were forced out of their tribes.

I found a venerable furbolg of the Foulweald tribe living above Lake Mystral--his name is Krolg.

I've watched him for days, and I think if I were to approach him in the guise of a furbolg, I could help him and discover a way to re-establish a bond between our people."
item_5505,Teronis' Journal,,,,item_text,0,"Along with killing Dartol, the furbolg split up the rod into three parts so it couldn't be used against them again. It has been difficult, but I've a good idea where all three parts were placed.

The Gem
The first part of the rod, a glowing gem, was hidden in a shrine in Northwestern Ashenvale. I believe now this shrine is the ruins at the center of Lake Falathim. The Sentinels tell me that it's been inhabited by murlocs now."
item_5505,Teronis' Journal,,,,item_text,0,"If I can't find the gem hidden in the shrine, it might be in the possession of one of the murlocs.

The shaft portion
This part of the rod was given to the treants near what is now called Felwood. Neither the furbolg nor my kind could have suspected that such magnificent creatures could ever fall to the corruption that's overtaken the land.

My research tells me that the guardians kept the piece in a small glade locked within a chest. To find out any more, I'll have to speak to Shael'dryn."
item_5505,Teronis' Journal,,,,item_text,0,"Shael'dryn is a dryad who protects the moonwell northeast of Lake Iris. She refuses to leave the forest or forsake it to the corruption. I know she has the power and knowledge to repair the rod, or to at least tell me how I can do it on my own.

The pommel
The pommel of the rod was given to the druids of Dor'danil. There is one major problem with this though: the druids are dead.

Their spirits now inhabit the area and are no longer hospitable."
item_5505,Teronis' Journal,,,,item_text,0,"This may require more investigation. I'm not sure I'm powerful enough to fight the spirits of my dead kin...let alone delve into the depths of Dor'danil and find the pommel.

We spoke over a few ales one night, and his tales have given me new hope of finding the pommel..."

item_5505,Teronis' Journal,,,,item_text,0,"It's a gamble, but I have no other clues at this time...

item_11727,Goodsteel Ledger,,,,item_text,0,"Greetings and Salutations, Adventurers!

I, Krinkle Goodsteel, have need of those willing to put themselves at risk in order to complete some of my most arduous tasks. Because of my many duties and the workload I've managed to take upon myself, I ensure that anyone brave enough to complete this list of items and return them to me intact will be paid handsomely. 

The list is contained on the following pages..."
item_11727,Goodsteel Ledger,,,,item_text,0,"Solid Crystal Leg Shafts - 

The Glassweb spiders of Searing Gorge are made of an incredible crystal-like material. Their legs, if not damaged when they're killed, make for a wonderful conductor in some of my companions' engineering experiments.

I will need a number of them to test  upon. The spiders having eight possible legs themselves should be no problem for a stalwart warrior or practiced mage."
item_11727,Goodsteel Ledger,,,,item_text,0,"An Overdue Package -

I hired someone who I thought was a reliable pilot to bring me a package from Theramore. I was apparently wrong. And even though the pilot lived to tell the tale, he left his entire zepplin and all of its cargo behind to save his own neck.

Well, I need that package back. From what Beezil tells me, he crashed just west of the bay in Dustwallow Marsh. It went down just after he crossed the hills along the water's edge.

Hmmm... never did tell me what caused him to crash..."
item_11727,Goodsteel Ledger,,,,item_text,0,"Goodsteel's Balanced Flameberge - 

Finally, I want one of my finest works of blacksmithing to date. This flameberge was an incredible sword that I bestowed upon what I thought was a very honorable and great warrior. Well, he was trounced by a murloc named Jarquai? Something like that. 

It was while he was traveling along the coast of the Swamp of Sorrows when he thought to attack the creature. He failed and apparently fled, but not before leaving the weapon behind for this murloc to take."

As Greatfather Winter walked Azeroth, bringing winter in his wake, it is said he would provide a bounty for those who welcomed his presence.  As such, the idea of feasting during the Winter Veil would bring together communities as they shared whatever they had.  Typically, a single day of merriment and feasting welcomed the change, all in anticipation of the land's renewal."
item_17735,The Feast of Winter Veil,,,,item_text,0,"Modern Day Observation$B$BOther cultures have begun to recognize the Feast of Winter Veil as a time of great celebration, though not in the same traditions as the legend bases it in.  Customs, often unrelated to anything other than a chance for celebration and gift exchange, have made their way into modern day observation of the season.  Even the image of Greatfather Winter is sometimes used, but more as a harbinger of commercial exploit rather than as a supernatural titan."
item_17781,The Pariah's Instructions,,,,item_text,0,"Set far back in the Valley of Spears is the holy temple of Maraudon. If that were not transgression enough, you will quickly see why I have asked a non-centaur to aid me in my plight.$B$BThere, just beyond the doors where only spirits and our most sacred priests and priestesses may travel is one called The Nameless Prophet. He is the highest of any tribe in spiritual matters and is one of the oldest of any tribe."
item_17781,The Pariah's Instructions,,,,item_text,0,"The Prophet is powerful, and communicates with the spirits of our ancestors. But he is a fool! He has no idea the true power he possesses. On his person is the Amulet of Spirits--it is where most of his strength comes from.
I have learned that the Amulet is powerful, but it is incomplete."
item_17781,The Pariah's Instructions,,,,item_text,0,"There are five gems missing from the amulet. And if those gems were found and placed back into the symbol, its power would far exceed that of its current form. I have found the five gems, but need one of your skill to help gather them. Slaying The Nameless Prophet is heresy for sure, as is stealing from his corpse, but what I would ask of you next would condemn any centaur for even thinking it."
item_17781,The Pariah's Instructions,,,,item_text,0,"Throughout the caverns of Maraudon roam the spirits of our first Khans. Our Mother and Father's first children, and our greatest leaders--they are Gelk, Kolk, Magra, Maraudos, and Veng. Each of these spirits holds one of the missing gems."
item_17781,The Pariah's Instructions,,,,item_text,0,"Use the power of the Amulet of Spirits to force them to manifest and take the gems from them! After, place the gems within the Amulet of Spirits and return it to me. Once I have the Amulet of Union, I will be powerful enough to reform the tribes so we can finally be as our ancestors wanted us to be!"

The learned soldier is the soldier that leans on the shoulder of experience. Let this book serve as a guide in your battle for Alterac Valley.
item_19483,Peeling the Onion,,,,item_text,0,"Chapter 1 - The Front Line Dismantling the Stormpike army is very much like peeling an onion. To get to the core, you must start by removing the outermost layers. The front lines, comprised mostly of Stormpike Mountaineers and Alliance Sentinels, are tied to the Captain's bunker. It is Captain Balinda Stonehearth who empowers these units and provides for reinforcements when the lines are under siege. Strike at the Captain and the front line forces will crumble."
item_19483,Peeling the Onion,,,,item_text,0,"Chapter 2 - The Twin Towers Make no mistake; Vanndar Stormpike is a cunning foe and certainly no fool. Once the front line has been breached, the secondary defensive targets must still be destroyed. It is the twin towers of Stonehearth and Icewing which control the Stormpike Guardians outside of Dun Baldar and the Stormpike patrols."
item_19483,Peeling the Onion,,,,item_text,0,"Beware, soldier, as both of these towers are heavily fortified and ruled over by one of Vanndar's elite Commanders. Should your forces breach the fortifications, make certain that the Commander within has been ... silenced. This too will be part of the dismantling of the Stormpike."
item_19483,Peeling the Onion,,,,item_text,0,"Chapter 3 - The Four Commanders The third layer of the Strompike onion is comprised of the four Commanders. In this respect, Vanndar has mimicked our own glorious Frostwolf defenses. Of course he will tell you otherwise... But I digress. The four Commanders control the ebb and flow of the Stormpike Guardians that fiercely guard Dun Baldar. Silence them all and the Stormpike Guardians will fall. Then there is but one layer left to peel."
item_19483,Peeling the Onion,,,,item_text,0,"Chapter 4 - The Dun Baldar Bunkers As you have undoubtedly noticed, the Stormpike defensive layers are in place to prevent one mighty power move from dismantling the entire army. Before you ask, yes, this is exactly how our own forces are setup and no, I will not change our defensive structure. They copied us, why should we have to change?"
item_19483,Peeling the Onion,,,,item_text,0,"Where was I? Yes, so, the Dun Baldar bunkers (which are located in Dun Baldar) control the Stormpike Defenders - Vanndar's most trusted and elite guard units. Destroy those two towers and the reinforcements sent to aid Vanndar will cease to exist."
item_19483,Peeling the Onion,,,,item_text,0,"Epilogue After having done all of this, you are left with the center of the onion: The sweet core. Vanndar Stormpike will be left defenseless and alone. Rules of military conduct require that we ask for his surrender before carrying out any executions. Be sure to mention the surrender thing when you see him... then kill him."
item_19484,The Frostwolf Artichoke,,,,item_text,0,"The Frostwolf Artichoke: Tales of Stormpike Glory
-By Vanndar Stormpike

What is Frostwolf? The answer is simple: The Frostwolf are savages trying to halt our sovereign imperialistic imperative.

Much like an artichoke, the Frostwolf have a prickly, shielded set of defenses and much like an artichoke, once the outer layer is peeled away, the heart is exposed, ready to be eaten with a fine garlic dip.

Delicious!"
item_19484,The Frostwolf Artichoke,,,,item_text,0,"Chapter 1 - The Front Line

The front lines of the Frostwolf defenses are comprised of Frostwolf Warriors. The warriors are deployed to the front lines from Captain Galvangar's fortress: Iceblood Garrison. The most efficient manner in which to take out this layer of the defenses is to destroy Iceblood Garrison.

Lay siege to the fortress and destroy Captain Galvangar. Once this is done, the front lines will crumble."
item_19484,The Frostwolf Artichoke,,,,item_text,0,"Chapter 2 - Iceblood and Tower Point

Once the first layer is down, the second layer of the 'artichoke' will be exposed. Destroying the Frostwolf towers that sit near the front lines will cripple the Legionnaire and patrols that swarm the rear flank.

The towers are heavily fortified, each housing one of Drek'Thar's elite Commanders. They must be killed. This will expedite the dismantling of the Frostwolf defenses."
item_19484,The Frostwolf Artichoke,,,,item_text,0,"Chapter 3 - The Four Commanders
 
If you have been following the wisdom of this guide, then by now, two of Drek'Thar's Commanders are dead. Good work, soldier! Their resolve is already weakening. You must now complete the dissemination of the chain of command by slaying the remaining two commanders.

With all four of the Commanders slain, the Frostwolf Legionnaires that guard Frostwolf Keep will be scattered - left without command. Ripe for the picking!"
item_19484,The Frostwolf Artichoke,,,,item_text,0,"Chapter 4 - The East and West Frostwolf Towers

There is now only one layer standing between you and victory; Drek'Thar's most trusted and powerful guard units: The Frostwolf Guardians.

The Frostwolf Guardians are sent out from the platoons held in reserve at the east and west Frostwolf towers. Destroy those towers and watch the remaining Frostwolf Guardians flee in shame."
item_19484,The Frostwolf Artichoke,,,,item_text,0,"Epilogue

""Smother the heart of the artichoke with garlic butter and mayonnaise. Compliment the meal with an aged, heady ale.""

Drek'Thar now stands alone, his two mutts at his side. Capture the Frostwolf Relief Hut to aid in your battle and destroy Drek'Thar. When the General falls, this land will finally turn over to its rightful owner: The Stormpike."
