Unknown,,gossip,,Search this rubble.
Unknown,,gossip,,"Find me something good, you dogs!"
Unknown,,gossip,,"If you're here, then it means you are prepared to begin the study of summoning demonic cohorts to do your bidding. We will start with the lowliest creatures you will be able to call and continue from there. Let us begin."
Unknown,,gossip,,The easiest creature for you to summon is the imp. You should already be able to bring forth this minion but for completeness' sake I will start with him.
Unknown,,gossip,,"This foul little beast is the imp. It is small and weak, making it almost useless as a meatshield, and its damage output is mediocre at best. This creature is best used for support of a larger group."
Unknown,,gossip,,"Now that you have had a chance to study the imp, let us move on to the next minion you will be able to summon, the voidwalker."
Unknown,,gossip,,"This demonic entity is known as the Voidwalker. Its strength and endurance are significant, making it ideal for defense. Send it to attack your enemy, then use it as a shield while you use your spells and abilities to drain away your opponent's life."
Unknown,,gossip,,"If you've never seen one, it is a sight to behold. A very impressive creature both on and off the field of battle. Next, let us take a look at what I am sure all you male students have been waiting for. The succubus."
Unknown,,gossip,,"All right now. Aside from the obvious distractions a minion like this will provide against your more masculine foes, she is also capable of dealing out impressive amounts of damage. However, her fragile endurance makes her almost useless as a shield."
Unknown,,gossip,,"Study hard and you might one day be able to summon one on your own, but for now it's time to move on to the felhunter."
Unknown,,gossip,,What you see before you is a felhunter. This creature's natural talents include spell lock and other abilities which make it unequalled when facing a magically attuned opponent.
Unknown,,gossip,,"When facing a spellcaster of any kind, this feral beast will be your best friend. Now, let us take a look at something a bit different. This next creature will aid your travels and make your future journeys much easier. Let's take a look at a felsteed."
Unknown,,gossip,,"I doubt you have had much occasion to see such a creature. These demonic equines will make your travels much faster by acting as your mount as long as you control them. However, they are difficult to control, so be sure you are ready before attempting it."
Unknown,,gossip,,"There you have it. Our lesson on summoning has come to an end. A new class will begin shortly, so if you wish to brush up, feel free to stay around."
Unknown,,gossip,,"I've been saving this spot for something special. I don't think it gets any more special than this, $N."
Unknown,,gossip,,"I am looking for some bodyguards that would like to protect the Gizelton Caravan. We are stopped on the road east of Kormek's Hut, north of Kolkar Centaur Village."
Unknown,,gossip,,There we go. All done!
Unknown,,gossip,,So sorry to leave a customer but we have places to go and people to swindle. We will be back sometime later today. Good-bye!
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,Hulfnar!  Thontek!  Stand and address me.
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,I want you both to demonstrate the techniques I have taught you for the benefit of the younger students here.  Ready...  begin!
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,Enough talk you two!  Commence fighting!
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,Ish nu!  That's enough!
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,"Good, good.  Now bow to each other."
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,Now bow to me.
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,Good job you two.  Now go have a seat.
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,Now that's a War Stomp!  Good job!
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,Start running!
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,Bring it on!
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,"Do not push me, or I will impale you on my horns!"
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,"You hold my father's blade, $N. My soldiers are yours to control, my $g Lord:Lady;. Take them... Lead them... The impure must be purged. They must be cleansed of their taint."
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,Very interesting!
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,This doesn't look good!
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,I dunno. What do you want to do?
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,Fishing sounds good.
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,I'm out of here!
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,Well done!
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,"That one, Malagan. I know $g him:her;. Dependable, brave, and trustworthy. $N is $g his:her; name."
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,"$N, eh? Oy! Citizen $N, come 'ere. Highlord Bolvar Fordragon has requested that all able bodied heroes o' the Alliance meet with him at Stormwind Keep. You just been recruited, mate! Get a move on!"
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,Ha! Now your death is ensured!
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,You dare! Now feel my wrath!
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,Edward. Tyler. Prepare for your first challenge.
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,"Lysta, summon in the captives."
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,"Not a challenge at all it seems. Let us see how you handle your second test. Lysta, bring forth the minions of the Lich King."
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,"Lysta, summon in undead captives."
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,It is time to face your final challenge young warriors! Prepare for your hardest fight yet.
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,"Lysta, summon forth... the abomination!"
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,Well done Edward and Tyler. You are progressing along in your training quite nicely. We shall test your mettle again soon.
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,Ugh! What is that scoundrel doing sending his vermin to me? Get out of my sight before I take what is left of your life. And take this with you.
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,"Theresa, take this to Father Lankester."
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,"Why thank you, my pet."
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,"Oh, great."
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,I hope this works!
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,Look at them go!
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,Kroshius live? Kroshius crush!
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,"Niby, you are stupid."
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,"This is it, Impsy. I can feel it! This is the big one!"
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,"When the time is right, my lady. All will be clear when the time is right. The master stirs even now. Look to the skies for the Brood of Nozdormu have returned."
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,NO!
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,THIS CANNOT BE!!
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,Grumble...
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,Why you little!
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,Ack! Help! Crazed gnome trying to kill me!
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,ARRRRRGH! He got me!
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,He's mine...
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,"My sword Archeus served me well in life, but as at last my spirit may pass from the unhappy existence, I need it no longer."
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,I shall cling to the love of my daughter and hope that I will find forgiveness under the Light for my sins.
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,"Watch, druid. The earth still breathes. It yearns to be cleansed."
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,"That is wonderous, Rimblat! Even this foul, sundered earth is not beyond healing."
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,The race will start in 1 minute!
Unknown_relaydb,,gossip,,And they're off!
Unknown_dbscripts_gossip,,gossip,,Your discs are now ready!  Engage the Discs of Norgannon once again to retrieve them!
Unknown_dbscripts_gossip,,gossip,,I SAID GOOD DAY!
Unknown_dbscripts_gossip,,gossip,,"Hey, who Fengus callin' a gnoll lover?!  Take da prisoners to da king; you smart to bring them with their weapons and show da king that they a threat.  I'll go see if Fengus talk smack when I give him da beatdown!  HAR!"
Unknown_dbscripts_gossip,,gossip,,"The enemy is upon us, stand ready!"
Unknown_dbscripts_gossip,,gossip,,Merok!  Shai!  To my side!
Unknown_dbscripts_gossip,,gossip,,Wait!  It appears our lookout has spotted something.
Unknown_dbscripts_gossip,,gossip,,"Soldier, call Captain Blackanvil at once!"
Unknown_dbscripts_gossip,,gossip,,"Look alive, lads!  The enemy has been sighted!  Form ranks immediately!"
Unknown_dbscripts_gossip,,gossip,,"Read through my catalogue, $N."
Unknown_dbscripts_misc,,gossip,,"Come, my acolytes. Take the rods of channeling and create the greater summoning circle."
Unknown_ai_scripts,,gossip,,The Frostwolf Graveyard was taken by the Horde!
Unknown_ai_scripts,,gossip,,The Stormpike Graveyard was taken by the Alliance!
Unknown_ai_scripts,,gossip,,Still no sign of the final shipment of explosives.
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"The Fanglords are dead! All hope is not lost!$b$bThe awakening ritual is quite complex, however. It cannot be done alone.$b$bI will handle all of the necessary preparations but I will need you to protect me. The nightmares summoned from Naralex's journey through the Emerald Dream prove to be quite formidable. Without your help, this mission is doomed.$b$bWhen you are ready to defend me, say the word, and I shall lead the way to Naralex's chamber."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,Rest your weary bones for a spell.
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"I am unable to process your chronological reference in comparison to the recording of this data, my apologies.$B$BThe trogg retains some composition of Azeroth's various stone core compounds, but the loss of cognitive power makes this variant unacceptable to the Creators.$B$BThe trogg procreates as per a standard biomass.  By default it consumes stone and anything else it can acquire, including other troggs.  Cannibalism is considered unacceptable by the Creators."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Initiating visual aid representation number two.$B$BThe second resultant variance of the Earthen matrix retains many desired elements when compared to the standard subterranean matrix.  The common nomenclature for this variant is ""Dwarf"".$B$BThis variant retains strength and stamina inherent to the Earthen.  In some cases, the dwarf even exceeds the cognitive powers of the Earthen's matrix.  The dwarf, however, retains none of the physical composition of Azeroth's various stone core compounds."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"The data stored in this repository does indeed correlate with your astute proclamation.$B$BThe dwarf maintains an affinity for the stone composition of Azeroth, but due to the high-stress environmental anomaly within the Earthen's synthesis matrix, the dwarf reverts to a default biomass composition as seen in the standard subterranean matrix.$B$BErgo, the dwarf variant does synthesize from the degeneration of the Earthen creation matrix, as you inferred with your query."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"I am unable to process your chronological reference in comparison to the recording of this data, my apologies.$B$BThough the dwarf maintains most of the Earthen's mental attunement to Azeroth's stone composition, the reversion back into living biomass remains the main degeneration of the matrix.  Dwarves eat and procreate through means typical to other standard biomasses.$B$BThe Creators view the dwarf as an acceptable variant, worthy of genesis in its own right."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"The Creators are... the Creators.$B$BThey are the beings that seeded and shaped this world by their own design.  They are the reason for this world's existence, as well as many other worlds.  They are the wellspring from which Azeroth flows."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"The Creators are cognizant of the magnitude of the information housed in this repository.  Subsequently, a portable copy of the data stored here will be made available to you once you are attuned with the Discs of Norgannon.$B$BPlease consider your cursory requirements for the assimilation of this knowledge to be complete.  At your leisure, access the Discs of Norgannon to begin synthesis of your discs."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"So ye want to be a Blacksmith eh? Grab an apron and a hammer $g lad : lass;, let's see what ye've got."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"I hope ye didn't come all the way to the Great Forge just to stay warm. Speak up $g lad : lass;, tell me what it is I can do for ye?"
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Welcome to Stormwind. Took a long time to rebuild her but it was well worth it. So are you visiting, or are you here on business?"
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"I sell only the finest arcane gear, made by the crafters and mages here in the city of Stormwind."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Since the fall of Dalaran and the destruction of Quel'Thalas, wares of this sort have been hard to come by. But Lucan Cordell and some of our other Tradesman have been doing a fine job of filling our orders with quality merchandise."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,Just browsing my wares or is there something specific I can help you find today?
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Best deals in all of Stormwind my friend, won't find any better. Now, what can I help you with?"
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"I sell only the best gear, tested and true. And the prices are set, so if you want to haggle then go find a Goblin."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,What is it you seek at my forge? Is it training? Do you perhaps seek the secrets of steel? The mysteries of the forge? Speak up Grunt!
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"You have the look of a $g man : woman; who seeks knowledge. Perhaps you seek the teachings of the forge, and the hammer. Perhaps I can guide you down that path. But only once you have accepted the spirits, and listened to their calling."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Want to be a smith? Want to forge blades to gut your foe? Hammers to crush his skull? Aye I can help, and gladly too if there is blood to be shed from it."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Greetings, $N. I see you've come from Orgrimmar to aid us. I'm glad. I want to be out of this forsaken forest as quickly as possible. I'd much rather be spending my time in Orgrimmar with a good ale.$B$BAlthough I cannot wait to hear how Belgrom talked you into coming out here."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"The arcane only corrupts those who are weak. Keep up on your training, or you may find a similar fate."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Um, hello!  If you are here about fee collection and/or a summons, then you must have me mistaken for someone else.  Terribly sorry!"
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,Cherry pie is my favoritist food in all of Azeroth.
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Fresh cherry pie for sale, looks so good it will bring a tear to your eye."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Try some of this cherry pie, it will put a smile on your face, ten miles wide."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"This cherry pie tastes so good, it could make a grown gnome cry."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,Having a bad day? Try some cherry pie.
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"This pie is so good, would you like some?"
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Nana always said there was no greater thing in the whole world than a warm, toasty slice of fresh, homemeade cherry pie."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,I love pie.
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,I think I hear him coming!  Look to the west!
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Hello, $n. If you'd like to learn a thing or two about cooking, please visit me at any time."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Finally! Put some fingers in your ears, your brain mighta just grown five sizes and I'm worried it might leak out.$B$BSo, the Dark Irons spared his life and took him prisoner. Their leader, some self-important, uppity fella named Thauris-something, took Ironfoe for himself. And that was the last I saw of ol' Windsor... *hic* 'scuse me."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"$G Mister:Missy;, if I didn't know better, I'd think you were one of them 'special' peoples. We call em Troggs.$B$BWindsor didn't have no beef with the Dark Irons, after all, his great, great, grand pappy's best friend was a Dark Iron. Which is also probably why that army of Dark Irons didn't kill him on sight."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,Good idea!
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"My master, Plugger Spazzring, is a good boss.  And he makes a lot of money.  His pockets are bursting!"
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,Be sure to try our Dark Iron Ale.  I hear the dwarves around here can't get enough of it.
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,Welcome to the Grim Guzzler!
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Of all the wondrous places within Darnassus, which would you have me direct you to?"
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Why you would want to leave these sunny shores and crystal blue waters I have no idea. It's like paradise down here. But don't tell my brother Zapetta that, he's bitter enough already about getting stuck up there in Tirisfal all day long. This Zeppelin here drops off at Orgrimmar so you shouldn't have to worry about having to listen to him whine. But if you are in Tirisfal anytime soon, heed my warning and don't get him started."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Lady Sylvanas has ordered the investigation of some of the natural phenomena of Azeroth. She feels there is something great to be learned from its secretive past.$B$BI know not how she learned such things, but I trust her completely, so I will do my best.$B$BI am currently investigating slimes, oozes and such. The creatures all seem to be similar in make up, but greatly affected by their environment.$B$BI could use your help in gathering samples of the creatures.."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,With pleasure... just let me savor this moment for a minute longer.
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,Wanna buy a cockroach?
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"I am Krathok, overseer of these craftsmen."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"The Scourge's plague still dominates the zone, and we have a long way to go before the plague will be altered enough to affect them.  Collect the necessary resources and help out the war effort!"
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"I hope the Light is with you, $N. Is there anything I can do for you today?"
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Slip a little coin into the boss's hand and look what it gets ya. I love my job. Though, if I could find a way to get that little firecracker Snurk reassigned to this port....well, I can't imagine it any better. But I'm betting that you aren't here about my business practices. You're looking for the Zeppelin to Undercity, am I right? Well that's great, because it docks right here behind me. Oh and hey, if you see Snurk, put a good word in for me, would ya?"
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Hey mon, you be needin' to head on over to da $c trainer."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"When I clawed my way out of the grave, I thought my family would welcome me with open arms. Instead, they drove me from the village, screaming in a language I could no longer understand."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,How may I be of service?
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"If you ask me, there's no greater profession than a miner.  And if you ask me, there's no greater miner than a dwarf!"
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Do not turn your back on the Light, $c, it may be the one thing that saves you some day."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Stormwind is the pillar of the human race, maintained through strength of will and the edge of a sturdy blade."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"The darkness does not embrace you, $c.  Cease your prattle and remove yourself from my sight!  Be gone!"
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Elune be with you, $c."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"$N, how may I further your training in the eyes of the Earth Mother?"
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"The Light protect you, $c."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Well met, $c.  You want some advice?  Befriend a mage!  We have a trick or two up our sleeves, we do..."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Welcome, my $g brother : sister;.  If you are here to train, then I would be delighted to train you.$B$BWe are the preservers of the balance, now and forever, as Malfurion lies in the Dreaming.  Never forget this."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"I do not see the warrior's spirit within you, child.  I have no teachings which would benefit a $c such as yourself."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Your skill exceeds mine, though  I've heard that Old Man Heming in Booty Bay has copies of ""The Bass and You"".  That is sure to help you increase your skill."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"I am an orc of medicine, $r. If you have come here to learn, I shall do my best to teach."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,I need many more supplies in order to upgrade our units.
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,You will need to find Nat Pagle in Dustwallow Marsh to get any better than you are currently.
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,I hold the key to lands of free! Chase me and you'll see!
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,Still alive? You do surprise. Watch me as I flee!
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,Turn that frown upside down!
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"This is the end of the line, no friend of mine!"
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Gaze upon the enemy, $r. See what the might of the Horde reduces even the most powerful of dragons to! All that oppose us shall meet a similar fate!"
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Perhaps one day, your contributions to the Alliance will be as great as the heroes you have seen this day. Honor them, $N."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,I can teach you how to cook!
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Look to this fallen dragon, $r. The might of the Horde is unquestionable!"
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,The Lord of Blackrock hangs from the arches!
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Alas... I am sorry to say I cannot currently give you your fortune, as you have recently received a fortune reading from me.$B$BReturn to me several hours from when you first received your fortune.  The forces of Fate will have properly recalibrated themselves, and I will be able to see into your future."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"The Paragons of Power are remnants from the ancient Gurubashi Empire.  We Zandalar seek them - not only are they of tremendous collectible value to us, but we believe that they also hold latent signatures of magic used by the old Empire.$B$BYou'll more than likely discover three kinds of Paragons in Zul'Gurub: coins, bijous, and primal items.  Bring them to us in the quantities that we seek, and you'll be rewarded with some of the finest items we Zandalar have ever crafted."

Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"I'm afraid ye would not survive long in Alterac Valley, $c.  Come back and see us when you have a few more seasons under your belt."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"$N, the Stormpike Guard is in need of your aid in the battle against the Frostwolf Clan in Alterac Valley, now more than ever.  The opportunities for honor and repute are greater than ever as well! Will you join the battle?"
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Thank you for the offer, $c.  Unfortunately you are not yet experienced enough to weather the hazards of Arathi Basin."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,Paragons of Power are powerful mojo.  They are Gurubashi Empire mojo.  We Zandalar must get mojo.  The tribe will take mojo for our own.

Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,Where would you like to fly to?
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"The silithid are no match for the sons and daughters of Orgrimmar.  Soon all that will be left of them are their crushed limbs and wings under our feet, $N."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"The world is indebted to you and your allies, $N."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"All will know of what has transpired here in this accursed temple, hero. It will be written about in history books - the tales told as legend from Azeroth to the far reaches of the Nether itself!"
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,That was quite a fight.  Let us catch our breath for a bit.
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"It looks like you've already found love. You can give me a love token, but I'm not giving you anything nice. I'm waiting for someone special."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,I'd like you better if you would apply some perfume.
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,I'd talk to you if you smelled better. Cologne would be nice.
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,My mission is compete. I may have some spare supplies if you need any.
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,I am unable to teach a Tauren to ride a Skeletal Mount.  I am sorry but there is nothing I can do for you.
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"I have tracked the various fragments of the staff across this world and in doing so, discovered Kel'Thuzad's plans to reform the staff. He has already collected several of the staff's fragments - which are being held by his most trusted lieutenants.$B$BI cannot emphasize enough the importance of keeping the greatstaff of the Guardian out of Kel'Thuzad's grasp. Frankly, I do not know what the result would be, other than a catastrophe of epic proportion."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"<Tarsis's eyes light up.>$B$BI held it once... I held it despite the warnings of the Kirin Tor. I held it, mortal... Power unending. Power to do what I desired, as I desired. And just as quickly, it was taken from me. But I had tasted... And that taste was all that it took."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian. The staff handed down through the ages to each of the Guardians of Tirisfal. The staff corrupted by Sargeras. The staff of the last Guardian. The staff of Medivh."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"<Tarsis grabs you weakly by the collar. Even in death you see power unimaginable in his eyes.>$B$BAm I? Then listen closely, for more nonsense is about to escape my lips. Within this citadel you will find my life's work: The exact location of every fragment of the splintered staff."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"I would have it back, mortal. Atiesh... From it I would create the Highborne anew. I would have it all back. Even the Queen..."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"I am Highborne, $r. It has no meaning now. There was a time, though, when this world was ruled by Highborne. Ten thousand years past..."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,The things I have done... such horrible things...$B$B<Tarsis begins to sob.>
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"<Tarsis groans.>$B$BThere may still be time... Listen closely, mortal.$B$BThrough time and across the Nether I have searched. Deals made with a host of evil and villainy so wretched...$B$B<Tarsis coughs blood into his hands.>$B$BWould you... would you believe that even Elune has turned her back on me, $r? To die here, in this manner now..."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Haven't you been listening? No, I very much doubt we would be having this conversation had Kel'Thuzad formed the staff. Kel'Thuzad holds the head. His underlings hold forty splinters of Atiesh. The last piece - the base - was uncovered by Brann Bronzebeard. He was last seen in the Silithus desert; undoubtedly doing his best to stay as far away as possible from the relentless seekers Kel'Thuzad has dispatched into the world."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Kel'Thuzad has put forth considerable effort in attempting to reform the staff. The pieces were once scattered across this world, from Kalimdor to the South Seas. I myself held twenty of the pieces at one point in time - until they were stolen from me by Kel'Thuzad's minions. It is why I am here."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,It was lost when the Violet Citadel fell... splintered into forty-two pieces.
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"I'm afraid that the blade which you hold in your hands is beyond saving. The hatred runs too deep. But do not lose hope, $c. Where one chapter has ended, a new one begins.$B$BFind his son - a more devout and pious man you may never meet. It is rumored that he is able to build the Ashbringer anew, without requiring the old, tainted blade."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"Aye, I did. Much to the dismay of the lesser Mograine, I made my way back to the Scarlet Monastery. I shouted and screamed. I told the tale to any that would listen. And I would be murdered in cold blood for my actions, dragged to this chamber - the dark secret of the order. But some did listen... some heard my words. Thus was born the Argent Dawn..."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"The blade and Mograine were a singular entity. Do you understand? This act corrupted the blade and lead to Mograine's own corruption as a death knight of Kel'Thuzad. I swore that if I lived, I would expose the perpetrators of this heinous crime. For two days I remained under the rot and contagion of Scourge - gathering as much strength as possible to escape the razed city."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"The boy had picked up the Ashbringer and driven it through his father's heart as his back was turned. His last words will haunt me forever: ""What have you done, Renault? Why would you do this?"""
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"It was all I could do to feign death as the corpses of the Scourge piled upon me. There was darkness and only the muffled sounds of the battle above me. The clashing of iron, the gnashing and grinding... gruesome, terrible sounds. And then there was silence. He called to me! ""Fairbanks! Fairbanks where are you? Talk to me Fairbanks!"" And then came the sound of incredulousness. The bite of betrayal, $r..."
Unknown_gossip_menu,,gossip,,"<High Inquisitor Fairbanks shakes his head.>$B$BNo... He stood in the background, watching as the legion of undead descended upon us. Soon after, my powers were exhausted. I was the first to fall...

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Oh, hi, $c. I guess the Alliance asked me to come here and keep track of all of this cooked meat that people are gathering because of the impending doom at Ahn'Qiraj.

To get ready for it we're collecting all sorts of material. I'm in charge of gathering Arthas' Tears. Not sure what we need them for though. If you ask me I don't want anything to do with that madman, even if it is just a flower named after him.$B$BStill, I'm my father's daughter, and a soldier, so I do what I'm told.

Then you know how weak and pathetic the high elf version of troll magic was?$B$BThe high elves could not understand why a people with their magical affinity could not contend with the powers of troll voodoo. This was an inconceivable notion for the pale skins to understand. They were resigned to using the bastardized version of troll enchantments. I believe they called them 'Arcanum.'
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I think I have heard of this magic.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"A friend of the Zandalrian! You have ventured deep into the lair of the Blood God, $c. You will do well to listen to what I have to say.$B$BMany thousands of years ago, while the indigenous trolls of the Zul'Aman empire were battling the invading high elf heathens, great magic was stolen from Zanza. This magic was used by the high elves to enchant their weapons and armor to assist in conquering the trolls of the region."

The fiery runes etched on the floor of the molten core are conduits to the realm of fire, and their presence is both an affront to us and a source of power for the Firelords.

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I keep 'em fed, kid. Yep, Daryl Riknussun, at yer service."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I require training, Zamja."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Can Zamja help you, $r?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I wish to browse your goods, Dirge."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Where can I find Crystal Restore?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Where can I get Enchanted Thorium?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Please, leave this place, $N. You know nothing of what troubles us..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I require training, Grimnur."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Yap, I can teach ye to fish."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I require training, Lumak."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Fish so delicious. You come learn fish? Eat fish? Mmmmm...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Stonetalon Mountain has many perilous caves through out this region.  Exploring these caves can hold many adventures for those willing to risk life for glory.$B$B$C, perhaps you seek riches that only following your heart and soul can garnish."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"So you're here for the Warsong axes. Well, it's about time, $N. That crate has been sitting out there for days, now.$B$BFeel free to haul it away whenever you are ready."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Myranda, do you have enough eyeballs to make another amulet? I have lost the old one."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Of course, Warchief!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I live only to serve, Warchief! My life is empty and meaningless without your guidance."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I... I did not think of it that way, Warchief."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"With all due respect, Warchief - why not allow them to be destroyed? Does this not strengthen our position?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Usurper?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What discoveries?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Please share your wisdom with me, Warchief."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Pathetic. You two do not deserve the training you are getting here if that was the best you can do.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I submit myself for further training my master.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I seek further druidic training to have a closer understanding of the Earth Mother's will.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,It is a greater knowledge of the ways of the warlock that I crave.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You know enough to be dangerous, but you still look like you need training to me $N."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"How fortuitous. Usually, I must leave my lair in order to feed."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Who dares attack the Silverwing Outpost?!?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ok, let's move out!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ragers, Fetch!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I got nothin' more to teach! Not for somebody who knows as much as you do, anyway! You Horde types need to talk to Nogg in Orgrimmar!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I wish to unlearn my talents.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Yes. I do.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Welcome, my $g brother : sister;.  If you are here to train, then I would be delighted to train you.$B$BThere will be a time soon where the call of the Emerald Dream will take hold in you.  You will hibernate for many years and walk amongst the purest of forms.  It is there and then that your ultimate training will take place."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,%s's medallion shatters.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Look at the wisdom and knowledge of the beast, and you will see yourself. Observe as the owl does, learn cleverness from the sabercat, embody the mighty spirit of the wolf."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I am ready, as are my forces. Let us end this masquerade!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The dragon hides behind a royal facade. The tablets will reveal her for what she is... If what I have seen holds true, I will not survive this battle, friend. It is you that must finish what I have started. Are your forces ready? Are you ready? We will begin on your command."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Was this fated, Windsor? If it was death that you came for, then the prophecy has been fulfilled. May your consciousness rot in the Twisting Nether. Finish the rest of these meddlesome insects, children. Bolvar, you have been a pleasurable puppet."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The Drag race will start in 1 minute!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Get your seats, folks!  The race is starting in 2 minutes!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What can you tell me about the hippogryph - Sharptalon?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What can you tell me about the nightsaber cat - Shadumbra?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What can you tell me about the bear - Ursangous?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Place Termite Barrel on the crate.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I would like to train.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Who sent you here? You're not ready for my instruction yet! You'll be told when you're ready.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You're doing very well in the art of tailoring, I must admit. Now, let's see how good you REALLY are..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Well done. You have now earned tailoring's highest honor. Go forth, and do terrible things with this knowledge!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The place is a bit drafty... but what do I care? I'm dead.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I am not worthy, sir."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I cannot help you until you have learned more of the essentials. Come back to me when you are ready.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You have come a long way, traveler. There is one more task for you to perform..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You have truly become one of the finest tailors in the business! Congratulations, I am proud to have been your instructor!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I have outfitted kings. With the proper training, you can too."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Good! I can tell that my efforts will not be wasted!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I will instruct you when the time is right... that time is not now. You have much more to learn first!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Before your learning may begin, I must ask of you a favor..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You require the instruction of a true master! Go to Daryl Stack in Tarren Mill and embrace your destiny!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Cloth is okay. Personally I prefer to work with human skin.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You'll need more training before I can share my knowledge with you, I'm afraid."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I require all my students to prove their dedication. Now it's your turn...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,There's only one person I know of who is more learned in the art of tailoring than myself. Last I heard he could be found in Theramore Isle. He is the person you should seek.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Yes, I've been running this shop for some time now. Business has been pretty good lately. A lot of new adventurers coming through..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,How can I share my secrets with a beginner? Try speaking with Victor Ward first.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Okay... so you wanna' be a tailor. How about you prove it?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You have worked your way up... time to see the boss. Go to Josef and tell him you are ready.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Tailoring can come in very handy. I once had to sew my arm back on.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You are truly a determined student. I will be happy to provide you with instruction!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"There are fundamental things you must learn before I can aid you. Speak to my apprentice, Vhan. He is kind and patient and will teach you what you need to know."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,There walks a hero.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I will require a demonstration of your determination before I share my gifts with you...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"My knowledge is limited, though I am still learning. It is time for you to move on, traveler. Find Josef Gregorian in Undercity and tell him you are ready."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Aren't the patterns beautiful? Each one speaks with its own voice.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Expertly accomplished! Now, let us continue your education..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You still have lessons to learn before I may begin your training. In the meantime, perhaps Vhan, in Thunder Bluff can help you."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,There is a task I would like you to perform before we go any further...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Your knowledge is great, traveler. You must learn from one who is wiser than I. Many tales have been told of the wisdom of Josef Gregorian. You may find him in Undercity."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Welcome to our tent. May I assist you?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You have done well, traveler. I am proud to call you my student!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"There are basics that must be learned. Trianna is standing nearby, speak with her and return to me later."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,There are many obstacles one must overcome on the path to excellence. Your path is no exception...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Your talents excel! You are truly inspired. To continue your pursuit of knowledge, speak with Georgio Bolero in Stormwind. He is held in high regard, and will be able to further your instruction."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What a fine day! It inspires me to create a new design.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Well well, not too bad. Maybe I CAN show you a few things..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Ha! You ain't got what it takes... yet! Come back to me after you've learned a few things!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Maybe you got it, maybe you don't. I think I got a way to find out..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Not bad... for an amateur! Still, you know about as much as I do. If you wanna' learn more you're gonna' have to talk to Josef Gregorian in Undercity."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"They say a stitch in time saves... what, eleven? Ah, I can't remember. Stupid saying anyway."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"What? Why are you bothering me? Why, I bet you can't even create a high quality robe! Go talk to Snang and come back when you're worthy of my talents!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You think you just walk up to me and I start teaching you? Ha! You need to pay your dues like everyone else!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You need to learn from someone who knows more than I do. Go talk to Josef Gregorian in Undercity. Well, what are you still doing here?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I made a lot of the things you see in the store. What do you think? Answer carefully, your life may depend on it."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I don't have time to babysit! Go talk to me assistant, Uthrar!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I don't train just anyone! You'll need to perform a task first!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Well, aren't you the smarty-pants? Ye know more than I do, I can tell ye that! Don't go getting' a big head, but if ye want to keep learnin', have a chat with Georgio Bolero in Stormwind. They say he knows his tailorin'!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ah, this Darnassian fabric is the finest!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,A fine display of worthiness. Your instruction may now continue.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Speak with Lawrence Shneider at Duncan's Textiles around the corner to the left. He is adept at dealing with beginners.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I will teach you, but first you must prove your worth..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You are beyond my level of expertise. Georgio Bolero, the master of Duncan's Textiles around the corner could help you advance your skills."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Good day to you.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Your understanding of leather is deeper than my own. Perhaps you should visit Aayndia Floralwind in the town of Astranaar in Ashenvale Forest. She has much knowledge to offer a student of your talents.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"What is this? You trying to ruin my reputation? I don't teach novices, $gbuddy:lady;. Go talk to Milla Fairancora in the Craftsmen's Terrace of Darnassus."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Thanks for your help, $N. Because of you, another shipment arrived safely at the excavation."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Are you here to help with the delivery? Miran's just about ready.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"This dock here?  Well you can catch the ship that goes to that Night Elf place.  What's it's name?  Uhh Auberdine I think.  I don't really know for sure, I just load and unload stuff."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Sure! Let's go for a ride.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I'm sorry but I can not let you ride my gryphons. You should go talk to Gringer if you need a ride somewhere.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Let me browse your goods.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I am afraid that I am no longer gentle or humble. Age and countless battles have hardened my skin and soul. Perhaps that is why Cairne assigned me to Sun Rock Retreat... the gentle winds and warm sun does ease the pain.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Dat's da attitude! Grab a needle and thread and let's get jammin'!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"At dis point you know as much as I do, mon. Maybe you go see Magar in Orgrimmar. He not be da happiest tailor around, but he help you anyway."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hey mon, what can I be doin' for you?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You will not be disappointed, traveler. Tailoring is a joyous endeavor."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"My education is ongoing, and your knowledge surpasses mine. If you wish to learn more you must speak to Me'lynn. She will guide you."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,There is no greater way to clear the mind than to weave.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I'm just a student myself, really. Rhiannon's the expert. She's standing by the crates over there. You can learn a lot from her."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,We don't get many visitors out here. May I interest you in something?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I am knowledgable, but I am not an expert. You know who you should talk to? Rhiannon! She's not far. Ask around for her in Undercity"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Pleased to make you acquaintance. May I help you?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"With the Earth Mother's blessing, we shall begin."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You seek a higher knowledge. Tepa is blessed with such knowledge. She should be standing somewhere nearby...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,No part of the animals we hunt is wasted.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I will teach you what I can.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I know a few things, but I'm no expert. Lucky for you, Magar is. He's standing near the back of the shop. See if he can help you, but be careful not to rile him. He can be irritable."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,We use many animal pelts and skins in our creations.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hold on there, I'm just an assistant. If ye want to start learnin' the fancy stuff, talk to old Stonebrew over there."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Welcome to me shop. What can I do for ye'?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I would be happy to take you under my wing. Let us begin.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,It is time for you to journey to Darnassus and speak to Me'lynn. She will guide you from now on.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Needlework requires a steady hand. And patience... above all, patience."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Very well, let your journey of tailoring begin."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Hmm... the things you need to learn are a little above my head. Have a talk with Sellandus over at Larson's Clothiers just up the path to the right. He taught me everything I know!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Life is like a carefully woven tapestry.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,So you would like to learn a few things? I would be happy to get you started!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I'm a simple man who knows a few things about tailoring, but you need more assistance than I can provide. I have heard of a Night Elf who is quite an accomplished tailor. He resides in Stormwind, in the Magic District."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I can tell that your wardrobe is in dire need of care.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"We cannot afford to give an inch in this war. Day and night, I create new armor, and I patch whatever can be salvaged from the old. I have no time for other tasks. Would you take care of something for me?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I only wish I had more students like you. Not many will venture so far into enemy territory. I salute your courage.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"All requests for my work must be made in person by the buyer. Orwin often asks me to reconsider, but my priorities lie here. Look around you: many of these fighters rely upon me for their armor."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I'm not here to teach babes fresh out of the cradle. Ye've nowhere near the amount of skill I require in my students. In fact, ye're a sad figure of a $glad:lass;, an' I'll thank ye not to stand there jibber-jabberin' at me."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I love a good challenge; don't you? Aye, of course ye do. An' that's why you're about to do exactly what I say."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Och, 'twas a sad day when I realized my obsession. I woke up and found myself tannin' before I had my first tankard of ale. Hardly even a respectable hangover! I knew then--aye, I knew!--how it was goin' to be."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I can make amazing things with the materials I find out here. By Muradin's beard, there are fantastic creatures in these hills! Go have a whack at them, $N, and bring me back some tall tales."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"It's been so long since I was a novice myself that I don't think I'd be the best teacher for you. Try talking to Tarn or Mak, right over there. One of them should be able to answer your questions."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"As members of the Horde, we must contribute to our community to ensure that it continues to thrive. Thus, I am certain you will gladly aid us by undertaking a small task I have for you."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Even my talents have a limit, and you have reached it. Congratulations, $N. Your next stop should be Camp Mojache in Feralas. The tauren Hahrana Ironhide lives there; she is renowned for her skill."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The needle is small, but the thread is strong, and the stitches are fine. Our pact with Thrall and the others will hold. The Horde will not be driven from these lands."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I regret to say that I cannot aid you, $gnoble sir:gentle lady;, until you learn more of working with leather. Speak with Faldron or Darianna here instead. They can teach you the skill you require."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You have demonstrated skill in learning our craft. Do you also possess the resolve to complete a mission on my behalf?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You have advanced beyond my skill to teach you. Journey now to Aerie Peak in the Hinterlands and speak with the dwarf Drakk Stonehand. His work is magnificent, far better than my own."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The grass is soft and lush. The air is fresh, full of light and song. Everything I've seen suggests that Teldrassil is a dream come true. Why, then, is my heart full of foreboding?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"In the northeastern Barrens lies a pool of water sickened by pollution.  The locals call it the Sludge Fen; the Venture Company has turned the once crystal-blue waters into a mire of industrial byproducts and waste.  In the heart of this fen lies what you seek, $N.$B$BBe warned - the Venture Company does not tolerate trespassers, and they consider anyone who does not work for them as such.  You'll especially be a target as a protector of nature, something they vehemently oppose."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"In the Silverpine Forest along the edges of the North Tide's Run, a derelict boat rests on the shore.  Out to the west of this lies what you seek; swim too far and the ocean will crush you from fatigue.  It resides on the ocean floor in a lockbox, waiting for you to claim it.$B$BYou'll be hard pressed to survive a dive to such depths without aid, so take heart; a bubbly fissure offers renewed breath to divers seeking this half of the pendant.  Use it wisely."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The waters of Westfall are where you must search, due west-northwest of where the Gold Coast Quarry meets with the shore.  An anchor shows where a boat has sunk beyond it, deep within the water.  The underwater pressure is fierce here; swimming too far will crush even the mightiest swimmer from fatigue.  $B$BLook for a natural formation to aid you, $N - a bubbly fissure is near here, offering deep-water swimmers a chance for renewed breath."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Do you know where I may find the Half Pendant of Aquatic Endurance?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Do you know where I may find the Half Pendant of Aquatic Agility?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I need a ride, Dungar!  I have important supplies to deliver!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I only teach students who have already mastered the basics. You must seek out the night elf Darianna in the Craftsmen's Terrace of Darnassus. Her skills will be a perfect complement to yours.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I cannot leave my post here, $N, but there is a task that must be taken care of. Can I trust you to see it done?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Training you further is beyond my abilities. Speak to Telonis in the Craftsmen's Terrace of Darnassus. He is always glad to help talented students.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Elune has granted the night elves many gifts. In return, it is our responsibility to safeguard these forests from the demonic taint that the Horde always brings with it."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"If I taught novices, there'd be a lot more students visiting me, and things would get noisy. Go talk to Dan Golthas over there. He's a little intense, but he means well, and he's a decent teacher."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Yes, yes, I'll train you. There's no need to raise your voice."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I'm pleased to say that your talents have outpaced my own. Go away now. Err, try the tauren Una in the northwestern shops of Thunder Bluff's central plateau. She's very skilled, I assure you."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Before my death, I was a librarian; I had nothing to do with wars and plagues. I never asked to become this. On the other hand, now that my mind is my own again, I'm not about to surrender without a fight."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You can't study my techniques until you've learned the basics. Speak with Kamari if you are interested in training.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"That's decent work, I admit. But I'd be more impressed if you'd handle something for me."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You won't learn anything new from me; you know too much already. If you want more training, talk to the tauren Una in the northwestern shops of Thunder Bluff's central plateau. Send her my regards, eh?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Am I busy? What's that supposed to mean? Do you think I just stand here all day, twiddling my thumbs? If you're here to buy something, talk to Handor."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"We're pretty far from anything I'd call civilization here, at least until the Horde can send us more reinforcements. You must really like working with leather."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"There's enough work here for an army of orcs, and most of it, only I can do. Still, there is a job I could use a hand with."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I'd train you if I could, but you're too much for me. Tell you what: go talk to the tauren Una in the northwestern shops of Thunder Bluff's central plateau. She's got some real talent."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"We have only a small foothold on this continent for now, but the humans can't fight us off forever. Then they'll pay for enslaving us. We'll cut their lying tongues out for their treachery."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Your skills are insufficient to learn what I teach. Try talking to Mak over there instead. He can help you out until you're ready for more advanced lessons.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You have come to me for instruction, and in return I have a favor to ask of you. See it done, and you will be rewarded."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I cannot help you with further training: your skill at working with leather rivals my own. You should speak with Una, over there. I will vouch for your skill if need be."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"My axe has seen many battles, and I like to keep it handy. Enemy forces have fought their way into our capital several times now, but have no fear: we have always driven them back."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I do not offer apprentice training. Look for the tauren Waldor in the Wailing Caverns, here in the Barrens. He can assist you with whatever you need."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"A task presses upon me, but I do not have the time to take care of it myself. Can I entrust you with it?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I cannot aid you with further lessons: your skills have surpassed mine. Go and see the tauren Una in the northwestern shops of Thunder Bluff's central plateau. She offers more advanced training.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"This blue leather does draw the eye, I know. You see, we have a great many eager recruits running around here, hunting and slaying with more enthusiasm than wisdom. One must take precautions."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Well, I declare! It's a new student! I'll gladly teach you everything I know once you have a little more skill. Go talk to Gretta Finespindle over there, would you? She'll have you up to speed in no time."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I can see that you'll be a quick learner. That's good for me, because I'm always busy these days. In fact, that reminds me: could you run a quick errand for me?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Nope, can't help you, I'm afraid. Your skills have mine beat! If you want to learn more, talk to the night elf Telonis in the Craftsmen's Terrace of Darnassus. He's amazing!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Lots to do! Haven't been this busy since my cousin accidentally vaporized all the cloth and leather in Gnomeregan. My, it was drafty for a while! Ah, $N, those were the days...."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"In time you will be ready for what I have to teach, $N. Until then, please ask Darianna over there to help you with your training."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"This war has been an enormous drain upon our people and resources. Even here on Teldrassil, we cannot escape its repercussions. Forgive me for asking it of you, but would you perform a task for me?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"If you are here for further training, you have overestimated my abilities. Have a word with Telonis over there; he can help you."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Darianna shows promise, but she is so full of energy that it is hard for her to stay still and listen. With her strength and agility, I fear it won't be long before she is called to fight. We must teach her quickly."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Come back to me when you've had more training. Randal Worth over there can help you with that.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Okay, I'll teach you, but I want you to do something for me. This is important, so pay close attention."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Sorry, but you've reached the limit of what I can teach. If you want to learn more, go see Telonis in the Craftsmen's Terrace of Darnassus. He's pretty talented, so I hear."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Randal's a bit of a dandy, but he's dependable, which is more than I can say for a lot of the students I take on. Still, I guess I can't blame them for wanting a bit of adventure."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Even I have my limitations! Go talk to Lavinia Crowe in Undercity if you wish to further your training.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"My teachings would be too advanced for you at this stage. If you wish to learn more of potions, speak with Tel'Athir here instead."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You were wise to seek me out. I would ask a small favor. In return, there is much I can teach you."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You are beyond my limited abilities. Seek out the night elf Ainethil in the Craftsmen's Terrace of Darnassus. She can teach you more. I only wish that I could go with you.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I'm free!  That device shall never torment me again!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Take every word I say and commit it to memory. Until our enemies have been eradicated, we must never shirk a chance to further our knowledge. Reinforce your armor, and never relax your guard."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I can't help you; your work is beyond my own. Talk to Arthur Moore, over there by the coffins. He'll be able to train you further."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Your talent is beyond my own, friend. Speak with Tarn here; his knowledge of leather is much greater than mine. I'm sure he would welcome another student."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Cairne himself lives here, they say. Once I have finished crafting a fitting gift, I will seek him out. Perhaps he will have words of wisdom for me."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Even here in the wilds, you seek out learning. Your drive for knowledge is an admirable trait."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The caverns below us are a source of strange and wondrous hides, but you must take care if you venture into their depths, $N. Remember that your own skin is far more valuable."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You have outgrown any teachings I could offer. Go with the blessing of the Earth Mother. Seek out the tauren Tarn in the northwestern shops of Thunder Bluff's central plateau. Be guided by his wisdom.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Meat, skin, bones... a good hunter lets nothing go to waste. Every scrap of leather can be salvaged, perhaps to reinforce an ally's armor. Thus, each of us is strong alone, but together we become invincible."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You've got the hang of it. I can't teach you any more, but talk to Arthur Moore, a Forsaken who works in the Rogues' Quarter of the Undercity. Tell him I sent you."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Skin, glorious skin. It holds your insides... in. You might've noticed my skin's not doing so well. To think I used to worry about my pores. Hardly any skin left to worry about these days. In a way, it's very freeing."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I have nothing more to teach you. Talk to Karolek if you wish to further your leatherworking skills.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You like the rug? I killed and skinned the beast myself. May all the centaur fall as easily.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Oh, goody, something else to do while I wait! You're a real life-saver, $N!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Aww, what rotten luck! My skills aren't good enough to be of any use to you. Oh well. Talk to Fimble Finespindle over there by the loom. He's been working with leather for longer than I have."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"This hide isn't ready to work with yet. I wish it didn't take so long to make leather. There has to be some way to cut down on all this waiting. It can't be good for my health, you know?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Oh, I'm sorry, but you know more about leather than I do at this point. Talk to Faldron over there if you wish to learn more."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"If you're interested in sewing with leather, you've certainly come to the right place. Faldron and Telonis are true artists, and I hope to learn much from them."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"My apologies, but you have already learned everything I know. The night elf Faldron could offer you further training, however. Look for him in the Craftsmen's Terrace of Darnassus."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Welcome to our home, $N. Radnaal and I have little to offer, but you are welcome to what hospitality we can provide."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"There's nothing I can teach you, other than maybe a better eye for color and detail. Talk to Simon Tanner over there; he knows a lot of advanced techniques for working with leather."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I already know a lot about style. Now it's just a matter of mastering the techniques for working with leather. Good thing Simon's a real sport about helping me learn them.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,How's it going? I love the smell of leather; don't you?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Gosh, I'm sorry. I don't have anything new to teach you. How about you go talk to Simon Tanner in the Old Town section of Stormwind? He's a human with big muscles and dreamy red hair."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Since my husband left for the front, Helene here has been my strength. Her kind heart and sharp sword have helped me through a lot of tough times. I don't know what I would've done without her."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"There are still lessons you must learn from others before my knowledge may be shared with you. Be diligent, and do not give up hope."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Your education is nearly complete. One final task is all that stands between you and the culmination of all your efforts...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I am proud. You are truly a gifted student. Now, for your final lesson..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Greetings traveler, you have my undying gratitude for dispensing with those dreadful creatures! I was beginning to think I might have to hide out forever!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Train hard, train every day. And when you have perfected your skills, return to me."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,True mastery must be earned! It is up to you to earn it now...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"There is only one whose skills exceed my own. You are ready to receive her knowledge. She is Annora, and you may find her... in Uldaman."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Have you come to seek the knowledge of Hgarth?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Your skills are truly becoming extraordinary. Now, let us continue your training..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You are eager, that is good. However, you are not yet ready to train with the likes of me."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"To come this far has not been easy, I know. But how boring life would be without challenges, don't you think? Good, because I have a challenge for you..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You have nearly reached the pinnacle of your training. To become the greatest enchanter you can possibly be, you have one more instructor to seek out. Her name is Annora, and you may find her in Uldaman."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What brings you to the Tower?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Well done! You have that spark in your eye... I know it well, it's the same spark I had when I was but a pup! Now, let's see if I can't teach you something."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You are unfit to train with me, stranger. Spend some time with my assistant Jhag over there."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You may have what it takes. Let's find out!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Your skills are out of my league, stranger.Talk to Hgarth at the Sun Rock Retreat in the Stonetalon Mountains. He will provide you with more knowledge than I can."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Some adventurers think enchanting doesn't work. I find that when I challenge them to battle they change their tune!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Greetings, traveler! Care to delve into the mysteries of the arcane? Hm?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Well, I've seen better. But, you have potential, I won't deny it. Pay attention and you just might learn something!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"No, no, you'll need FAR more training before you're ready to learn from me! Go talk to that uptight dabbler Malcomb Wynn. He's the one buried in books over there."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hmm, you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. If you do what I ask, and do it well, maybe we can discuss your training."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"If I wasn't stuck here day in and day out, I would have attained the mastery required to train the likes of you! Unfortunately that's not the case. Go talk to Hgarth at the Sun Rock Retreat in the Stonetalon Mountains."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I don't get many visitors.  You're looking for something specific, yes?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ah, very good. I am satisfied that you are a worthy student. Now, your training with me may begin..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Surely Mot didn't send you to me? He knows better. You are not yet capable of understanding what I would teach you. See my son Mot, just outside there, and finish training with him."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I will teach you... soon. I require a demonstration of your loyalty, first."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"There is one whose knowledge exceeds my own. You are ready to seek her out. Go to Sun Rock Retreat in Stonetalon Mountains. Find Hgarth, and continue your training."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Enchanting has run in our family for generations. I learned at an early age, just as my son is doing now."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You have gone to great lengths, stranger, and you have my appreciation. I promised to further your training, and now I shall keep that promise."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I would be happy to teach you when you are ready, but that time has not yet come! I'm sure Lalina Summermoon will guide you until then. You may find her in the Craftsmen's Terrace in Darnassus."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Why don't we see just what you're capable of? If you complete the task I shall be happy to further your training!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I know many things, stranger, but your knowledge rivals my own. Enchanters who wish to hone their skills further are known to travel to the Tower of Azora, where an artisan named Kitta Firewind resides."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"If you are seeking a truly rewarding pursuit, then a life of enchanting is for you!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You have not yet learned the basics, wanderer. Have you spoken to my assistant, Lalina Summermoon? Perhaps you should."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I believe you are up to this task... will you accept the challenge?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You are an exceptional enchanter. Beyond my talents as a teacher, I fear. Seek out Kitta Firewind at the Tower of Azora. Only she can qualify as your instructor now."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,It is true I have skills to teach to those who are worthy. Would that be you?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You are not ready. Speak to Betty Quinn, she's standing by the stairs over there. Return to me when you have achieved a higher enlightenment."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You seem confident. Surely you wouldn't mind a test of your skills?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"A true professional know his limitations, and I'm not ashamed to admit that your skills exceed mine. I want you to pay a visit to Kitta Firewind at the Tower of Azora. She is well-renowned, and with good reason."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"If you have what it takes, I will be happy to show you the way."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You're joking, right? I believe you're looking for the OTHER short fellow, Thonys Pillarstone. He's downstairs. Now skedaddle!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Great, let's get started... ha! Fooled you! Surely you didn't think it would be that simple. You'll need to prove your mettle just like everyone else!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"What do I look like, the Grand Poobah of enchanters? Your skills require the guidance of an Artisan! Go find Kitta Firewind at the Tower of Azora."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Who are you? What do you want from me?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"To die in battle is glorious! But, with what I teach you, maybe you not die so quickly, hm?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You come to wrong place. Talk to the expert Godan over there. You learn more from him.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Throm-ka! What you looking for, stranger?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I cannot teach you anything you don't already know. However, the knowledge of my father far surpasses my own. Go inside and speak to him. Good luck!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"What I wouldn't give to be out on the open plains on a day like this... but, my duty binds me."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You don't look like much to me, but who knows, maybe there's an enchanter hidden in there somewhere!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Eh, well you've made it this far... go see Lavinia Crowe by the other bookshelf there. If you don't mess things up with her, maybe you can learn some more."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I do not have time to waste, stranger. State your business or be off!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Open your mind, wanderer, and we shall begin."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You have truly excelled in your knowledge of enchanting. There is much more to learn, if you are willing. Speak to Taladan, in the Craftsmen's Terrace in Darnassus."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Elune's secrets are many, but they are not to be shared with just anyone."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I will teach you what I can. Each lesson is a gift from the Goddess herself. Use her gifts wisely, and you shall not falter."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Your skills are beyond my reach. It is time for you to face new challenges. Taladan will help you prepare. He is standing by the table there.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The Goddess has granted me wisdom, stranger. If it is her will, I shall pass it on to you."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ye're a fine enchanter indeed! Now it's time fer ye to move on. I want ye to talk to Gimble Thistlefuzz, upstairs. He's a bit of a character, but he'll steer ye in the right direction from here on out!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"There are ways to strengthen steel beyond the hammer and forge, young wanderer. Care to learn more?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hmm... well you seem capable enough. If you truly desire to learn, then nothing will stand in your way! I will guide you through your first steps on what I hope will be a long and fulfilling path."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I'm afraid I have nothing to teach to someone with your experience. But you haven't reached the end of the road yet. Speak to Lucan Cordell, behind the counter there. He'll guide you through the next phase of your journey."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hail, traveler! What brings you to my doorstep?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Show me what you got! You won't be sorry, I promise!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Well my friend, you've reached heights some people only dream of. Congrats! And now, without further ceremony, it is time for your final lesson!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I've been working on a way to transport oil underground between major cities, but everyone tells me it's a pipe dream."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Nice going! I knew I was right about you, no matter what those other people said. Ha! I'm kidding! Okay, on with your lessons..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Nice try, but you'll need some more experience before training with me! Back to the trenches!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I think you're more than qualified for this little assignment... let's see if I'm right!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I can't teach what I don't know! If only there was someone else who knew more than I do... wait, there is! Go see Buzzek Bracketswing in Gadgetzan!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Sometimes I surprise even myself!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The things I would teach you would turn your brain to jelly! Come back when you've learned sufficiently!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Not that I doubt your abilites, but I would like you to perform a task for me. Call it a demonstration of good faith..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You have certainly come a long way in your training. There is only one instructor who can train you further. Find Buzzek Bracketswing in Gadgetzan!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"If my calculations are correct, the wheel will soon be obsolete!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Well... you almost impressed me. I suppose I could spare the time for a few lessons...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"This is a waste of time, mine and yours! Go see Graham Van Talen if you want to begin your instruction! He's standing to my left over there."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Let's see how competent you are, shall we? If you perform this task to my liking, I'll spend the time to teach you!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What do you think I could teach you? Roxxik would do a much better job. You can find him in Orgrimmar. Now be off!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I don't have time for idle gossip, I'm a professional!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You have passed your test, well done! Your training may now continue."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You have not yet earned the right to train with me. See Thund first, over by the table. Come back when he says you're ready!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Every day is a test, and this day is no different. If you pass this test, I will share some of my knowledge..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You have earned the privilege of training with a higher instructor. Go see my pal Roxxik there.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,If there were just a few more hours in a day...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Close, but no cigar! I'm afraid you'll have to talk to my sis, Jemma first. After she's gone over the basics with you, come see me and I'll show you the juicy stuff!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You'll need to prove your worthiness before I go giving away my secrets! I've got just the test for you...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Don't tell anyone else I said this, but even I don't know everything! If you want to keep learning, you should talk to the owner of the shop, Springspindle Fizzlegear."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The plans for my twenty-foot tall turkey baster are nearly complete! Now all I need is a twenty-foot tall turkey...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You can learn from me in time... but not yet! Why don't you start out by talking to Sprite Jumpsprocket to my right here. You can check in with me after you've gotten your feet wet!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Quid pro quo! I'll teach you what I know, but first I want you to perform a small task..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Well, you're just zooming right along! I can't teach you anything you don't already know, but Springspindle Fizzlegear sure can! You can find Springspindle in Ironforge. Good luck!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Let's see... fourteen plus seven, carry the two... oh, yes?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Fantastic! Aren't you the industrious one? Well, let's get started, shall we?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hmm... well, I can't help you quite yet! You have to learn the basics first. Why don't you go see Sprite Jumpsprocket in Stormwind!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I can show you a few tricks... if you don't mind doing a little something first, that is."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You're working your way up... higher than me, at this point! You should talk to Springspindle Fizzlegear in Ironforge! (He'll? She'll?) show you more than I ever could!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I'm never too busy to speak to a stranger! Almost never, anyway..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Engineering will provide you with the skills and knowledge to dismantle your opponents! Let me show you how...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You are ready for greater things! See Franklin Lloyd, to my right. He will guide you from now on."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The Dark Lady has said that knowledge will be our greatest weapon in this war.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You know who's really smart? Nogg! Smarter than me, even. You go tell Nogg Thund sent you! You can find him by the control panel over there."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Who says Orcs aren't smart? It takes a lot of brains to be an engineer!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I know a few things. You want me to show you?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You know who can really show you some things? Nogg! You go find him in Orgrimmar.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I like to build stuff. Of course, I like to blow stuff up even more!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"A fellow enthusiast, huh? Well, you just wait, we'll make a gearhead out of you in no time!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I'm afraid you're out of my league, friend! You should go see Nogg in Orgrimmar, he'll take you to the next level!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"(Sniff, sniff) You smell that? Don't you just LOVE the smell of grease?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Yeah, I'll show you a few things. We'll see how you do, maybe you'll surprise me!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I can't help ya'! You're ready to see someone who's been at it longer than I have! Let's see... you're an Alliance type, so you need to talk to Lilliam Sparkspindle in Stormwind."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What? You want something?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"This kind of work isn't for the faint of heart. I have an uncle who lost a hand! Poor old Stumpy... anyway, if you're still interested I might be able to show you a few things."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You need to start learning things that are beyond my expertise! Talk to Lilliam Sparkspindle in front of the tent there. He'll set you on the right course!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ah, what a beautiful day to blow something up!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You want to train? With me? Fantastic! The only thing better than assembling bullets and explosive devices is to share that knowledge with someone else! Let's get started!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Oh, you've got oodles of things to learn still. I would teach you everything if I could, but I'm still learning too! Why don't you talk to Trixie Quickswitch in Ironforge, she'll help you further your education!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Hello there! My name's Jenna! And you?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Well... I hate to admit it, but my sister's the one you'll have to talk to if you want to continue training. I don't know as much as she does... yet! She's standing over by the rocket car."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I heard the new Henweigh 6000 will be rolling off the assembly line soon. I can barely contain my excitement!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I would be delighted to aid you in the commencement of your pursuit! Let me grab my spinner and we'll get started...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Your current aptitude exceeds my instructional capabilities. You should enquire further with my fellow Gnome Trixie Quickswitch in Ironforge!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Where's my spinner? I just had it here somewhere...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Lookin' to be an engineer, eh? Well, by Muradin, ye've come to the right place!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I would train ye if I could, but ye need the services of someone a bit more... what's the word? Brainy! Look for Trixie Quickswitch in Ironforge. Tell 'er Bronk sent ye!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Just a minor adjustment here... ah there we go!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Argh, the pain. Will it ever leave me?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ah, $gpriest:priestess;, you came along just in time. I appreciate it."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"How dare you ask me for training, maggot? What were you hoping for, you slack-jawed yokel, a lecture on the proper uses of silverleaf? Out! You're lucky I don't thrash you senseless for wasting my time."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hmm, well, I can see that you have a little skill at making potions. Whether you're worthy to be my student remains to be seen, however. I have a job for you. Impress me."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Don't stir the potion like that, you ham-handed farmer! No, don't stop stirring it, either! Forget it--just give me that ladle before you start a fire. I'll salvage what I can. Now, pay attention."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Warchief Thrall himself asked me to come out here. I was honored to obey, and it's no hardship. I couldn't have asked for a better posting than Stonard. Just about any herb I might need grows in the muck here."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Kalaran, I have misplaced my torch. I require another."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Elune has seen fit to gift me with skill and experience. Now I shall pass them on to you.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Have you come here for instruction in the art of making potions? You were mistaken if you thought that I would offer such a privilege to you, unearned. Go, and do not return to me until you have greater skill."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Once I welcomed darkness, for it was the sister of night. Now it is dark all the time, even during the day, and the forests cry out for sustenance. Unless we act soon, this spreading blight will cover the world."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You don't yet have the skill to study with me. Go talk to Doctor Martin Felben over there, or go up the ramp to the southeast and see Doctor Marsh. They are Forsaken who can give you the training you need."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You've got real talent and a passion for making potions. There is one little matter I'd like you to take care of, though."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Incredible. Your potions display a knowledge that rivals my own. I cannot train you further, but talk to the orc Rogvar of Stonard in the Swamp of Sorrows. He's known for his cutting-edge experiments."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"My colleagues and I are gathering the deadliest substances we know and testing their effects on our enemies. Once I have everything I need, I shall brew such plagues as this world has never seen."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Your skill at brewing potions needs to be greater before you can become one of my students. In the meantime, perhaps Sylvanna Forestmoon or Milla Fairancora can help you, just over there."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,This is excellent work. Are you ready to undertake a mission on my behalf? I know of no one more qualified.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,It is time you moved on to a more advanced teacher. In the Feathermoon Stronghold of Feralas dwells the night elf Kylanna Windwhisper. She has a brilliant mind; doubtless she can train you further.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"This potion seems to heal less damage every time I brew it, though I use the same ingredients. There can be only one conclusion: the plants are changing. I cannot say why or into what."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I'm not amused by your audacity in coming to me for training. Go through the archway and down the ramp to the southeast, and talk to Doctor Martin Felben. He is a Forsaken who can teach you the basics."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"If you seek to become my student, you'll need to complete an assignment for me. Prove yourself worthy, and I might even consider rewarding you."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I have no more knowledge to bestow upon you. Go through the archway and down the ramp to the southeast, and talk to Doctor Herbert Halsey. He is a Forsaken who can teach you more advanced techniques."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"With Algernon to keep me supplied, I can do all my work here without hunting for a single herb. If I never have to see the wonders of nature again, it won't be too soon."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"My powers have returned and you have squandered your chance, foolish mortals. Till we meet again."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Another student. Wonderful. This is why Lydon belongs to the Royal Society of Snobs and gets to do research, and I'm stuck being an instructor. If I win another teaching award, I'll never live it down!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Don't waste my time. I have research projects older than you. Go talk to Doctor Martin Felben in the Apothecarium of the Undercity. He's a Forsaken who can probably manage to teach you the basics.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"If you're going to be taking up my time, you'd better prove you're worth it. I ought to get something out of this arrangement, after all."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Me, train you? Come on--we both know I can't. It's this teaching, you see. My own skills suffer. You want training, go to Doctor Herbert Halsey, a Forsaken in the Apothecarium of the Undercity."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Another interruption. How am I supposed to get any work done like this? Don't answer that; do I look as if I care what you have to say? Why don't you go bother Mr. High-And-Mighty instead?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You have some skill, it is true, but every moment I spend teaching you is one more moment the undead will spend in torment. Prove to me that you are worth my time."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I cannot in good conscience spend time training novices while our allies, the undead, are suffering so terribly. Please speak with Kray over there instead; he can help you for now."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Can you not sense the anguish of the Earth Mother for her lost children, the undead? Speak quickly, $N. Every second costs me dearly. We must help them find their way back to her!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"When I first saw the undead, I wept, for I could not imagine their horror and loneliness. The Earth Mother spoke to me then; she sang in my blood. And she told me, ""Save them."""
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You're better at this gig than I am! You want someone with even more experience than I've got. That'd be Ainethil, a night elf lady who lives in the Craftsmen's Terrace of Darnassus."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Herbs are so pricey! I could always use a little something extra, if you know what I mean. Help a goblin out?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"What is this? You trying to ruin my reputation? I don't teach novices, $gbuddy:lady;. Try talking to the orc Whuut in the Drag of Orgrimmar. He's a lot closer to your level of skill. And brains."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I've got plenty of great recipes for you to take a look at, and at discounted prices, too!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Glyx and I have an understanding: he keeps me supplied, and I keep him rich. Seriously! What that pirate charges me for a measly pouch of crumpled kingsblood... it's enough to make a grown goblin cry."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You're talking to the wrong orc. I don't train novices. Talk to young Whuut over there... and use small words.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I've been looking for a little help. Since you've got the skill, I guess you'll do, provided you've also got the guts."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I'm honored to meet you, $N, but your skill at potions is greater than my own. Go see Doctor Herbert Halsey, an undead in the Apothecarium of the Undercity. He can help you from now on."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I'm busy, $N. Tell Whuut to handle whatever it is. That young pup has been stewing all day long. He spends much more time like that, and he's going to hurt something."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ah, to be young again, and to have discovered potions for the first time. Thank you for refreshing my memory, $N. Now go share that youthful enthusiasm with Milla Fairancora over there."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Your skill is not inconsiderable. Since you appear to have sufficient experience, there is a matter in which I require your aid."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"My skill at creating potions is inferior to yours. You are ready to speak with Ainethil, just over there. She will understand that you are ready for further instruction."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Even slight alterations to a potion's ingredients can change it fundamentally. Patience and precision, young one: they will serve you well in all walks of life."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You have learned the fundamentals of making potions, but further study requires greater commitment. Prove your dedication by carrying out a task for me."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"My apologies, $N, but I do not offer instruction to novices. Instead, talk to Milla Fairancora in the Craftsmen's Terrace of Darnassus. She can help you make up for lost time."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Teaching is not a one-sided trade, $N. As I teach you, I learn more myself, and my understanding grows."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ishnu-dal-dieb, $N. Have you come here in search of knowledge?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"That's nice, $N. Go show whatever it is to Vosur over there. He'll answer any questions you have."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hey, that's actually not so bad. Alrighty, then. How'd you like to run an errand for me?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Um, you already know everything I could teach you. Maybe it's time for you to talk to someone else. Try the night elf Ainethil in the Craftsmen's Terrace of Darnassus. She's got some real talent!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Don't let the beady eyes and bushy beard fool you. Vosur's a talented apprentice and a good friend, even if I do get a crick in my neck when I talk to him."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You've put in your time studying the basics. Now it's time to up the ante.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I'm sorry, $N, but I have no time to spend on novices. You want someone closer to your own skill level. Try the night elf Milla Fairancora, in the Craftsmen's Terrace of Darnassus."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"There's nothing more I can teach you. I've heard of a night elf who might be able to, though. Her name is Ainethil, and she lives in the Craftsmen's Terrace of Darnassus."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Stop giving me that look. I may not be an adventurer like you, but that doesn't mean I can't have a few muscles. All that stirring makes your arms strong."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Very well. Cut another lump of flesh from one of these specimens. Let us test what you've learned so far, and we can progress from there."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Once, it is true, I was human. What might otherwise be a shortcoming works to our advantage, $N, for I know human weaknesses intimately."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Here to learn about potions? I've got plenty to teach you. I might be dead, but I haven't lost my brains. Yet."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Nice to see a friendly face. I don't get much chitchat from Apothecary Johaan unless he wants something. He's been out of the grave too long. Someday I'll be like that, I hear. Creepy. Maybe by then I won't care."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I must have broken hundreds of vials when I first began brewing potions. The glass was so fragile in my clumsy hands. I hope you are more cautious than I was.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Bena works like one possessed. Day and night I have seen her bent over these potions, often going without sleep or food. I know our undead allies need help, but I begin to fear she will do herself an injury."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"They called me stupid, but I'll show them. I'm going to watch every pot I have and prove that they can all boil stuff anyway. Yeah, I'm on a roll! Who's stupid now, huh? Huh!?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,All the bottles on this table are potions I brewed today. And they say a watched pot never boils. Ha!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You got questions, but they be too big for me to answer, $N. You be needin' to have words with the orc Yelmak in the Drag of Orgrimmar. He'll help you out."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ready for another lesson? All right, then. First, relax. You gotta stay loose to stir a potion just right."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You got the look of someone wantin' adventure. Me, I had enough of that by the time we trolls came here. Now I take each day as it comes, an' I train other folks to handle adventures for me."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Put your back into it, $glad:lass;. Hard work and determination--that's the way! Don't let anyone tell you book learnin' is all ye need."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Don't let those big, innocent eyes fool ye. Tally's an expert, all right: I learn something new every day. Why d'you think I'm here in Tinker Town? Do I look like an engineer to you? Aye, I didn't think so."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I don't suppose you're here to talk about my lovely Kali. Fine, then. Potions it is. Anyone ever tell ye you've got a one-track mind?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Did my sweet lass Kali send you down to me? The apple of my eye, she is."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Is it not astonishing what one can create from the plants of the forest? Truly, Elune has blessed us with her bounty."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Elune-adore, my $gbrother:sister;. You are welcome here. Speak, and I will do what I can to aid you."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Unfortunately, there is little I can teach someone with your experience, my friend. Seek out the night elf Sylvanna Forestmoon, who resides in the Craftsmen's Terrace of Darnassus."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Well done! Your understanding of potions is coming along nicely.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The druids say that it is only a matter of time until nature itself drives the Horde from Kalimdor. Yet corruption continues to spread throughout our lands, even here on Teldrassil."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I am honored to share my knowledge with you, $N. See that you use it well."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Shut inside this little house, I dream of joining the battles that rage outside the city walls. Still, duty compels me to share my knowledge with others who fight in my stead... for now."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You've made a good start, but you still have a great deal to learn, $N."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Good day, $gsir:ma'am;. I'd shake your hand, but as you see, I'm in the middle of something. May I be of assistance?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You challenged us and we have come. Where is this master you speak of?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"We, his sworn servants, do his bidding and enforce his iron-rule. Cut off from the energies of his fiery realm, Ragnaros is but a shadow of his true self. However, he has more than enough strength to be your end."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What else do you have to say?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"A mere three hundred years ago, a reckless dwarf named Thaurissan summoned the master from his fiery realm. His return to this paltry world devastated the surrounding lands and created this volcanic Core. Mighty Ragnaros has slept under this mountain ever since."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I need a ride, fast!  I have an important message to deliver!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Da spirits be strong wit you, mon. What kin dis troll do for ya?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The spirits have guided you to me. How may I be of service?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Teach me the ways of the spirits.

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Tell me more.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The Firelord and his brethren once held sway over this entire world, mortal. As a servant of the Old Gods, he fought against the Titans for domination of this planet. The victorious Titans banished my master and his brethren to the Elemental Plane - there to remain imprisoned until the end of time."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I seek training in the ways of the Hunter.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Yes. I have.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"While Theramore is reknown for it's exceptional training of warriors, I am afraid that I can not help you."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Due to incompatibility on your class specification, I am unable to help you rectify any situation you have with lack of ability."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Take it easy, mon. I only train da warriors."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I'm Augustus!  You want it, I got it!  You wanna sell it, then I want it!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I'm Augustus, and my prices are INSANE!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You won't find better prices anywhere!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Greetings, $c. Please be brief in how the Kirin Tor may be of service to you."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Yes, Augustus.  I would like to do business."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Commerce!  I crave it!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Before the Scourge came, I had a great business.  I bought and sold everything.  Everything!$B$BAnd my prices were INSANE!$B$BJust ask anyone.  Anyone who's not dead."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"May Cenarius watch over you, $g brother : sister;.$B$BI am Tajarri, and I am a sworn protector of this shrine.  It is my honor to serve Keeper Remulos as a warden of this sacred land."

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"My chest is one of ingenious design, and requires two keys to unlock, one gold and one silver.  The first key, the silver key, I gave to my first mate, and I kept the gold.$B$BBut we were doomed to lose them.  My key was lost during the next naga attack, and my first mate's was lost a day later when drysnap makrura assailed us and pulled him into the deep.$B$BI am sure the naga and makrura have the keys.  I am glad the two are enemies and will not share them."

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"If you're here to be trained in the tactics and strategy of hunting, you've come to the right place!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I wish to train.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Remember, all things are connected. If the beasts were gone from the land, our kind would die from a great loneliness of spirit, for whatever happens to the beasts also happens to the Tauren. Whatever befalls Azeroth befalls all those that inhabit it."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I seek training to ride a steed.

Please, inspect them for yourself and see."

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Before beginning a hunt, it is wise to ask someone what you are looking for before you begin looking for it."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You are not known to my people.  A kodo is a mighty steed, and it is the product of love and care by my people; such is not given onto strangers.  Until the elders of Thunder Bluff consider you to be a friend, I cannot offer you the sale of a kodo."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Years of quality breeding techniques and plenty of care allow me the privilege of showing you these horses!  Please, take your time as you consider them for your mount.  A horse is a companion for the ages, friend.  Don't sell yourself short - get your steed here today!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Sorry, but I am not disposed to sell horses to any individual who is not considered to be at least friendly to the Kingdom of Stormwind.  These steeds are the finest you'll find anywhere, and we certainly wouldn't want them in the hands of our enemies.$B$BNot saying you're an enemy, of course... just earn the trust of Stormwind and then we can do business."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You've not had a steed until you've taken the reigns of a finely bred Barak Tor'ol mountain ram, my friend.  Please, feel free to inspect these fine companions to any adventurer.  They'll serve you well, believe me."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I am curious to see what a bucket of bolts has to offer.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Not so fast, $g guy : lady;... I'll not be handing out the reigns of a mighty ram steed to someone that's not a proven ally of the dwarves of Ironforge.  Once you've been recognized as friendly to Ironforge, I'll gladly show you what varieties of rams I have for sale."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Yes, I have. Teach me."

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The felhound... a vicious creature indeed. It is not as physically strong as an infernal, but a wise warlock knows that brute force is not always the answer--if it was, you would have chosen the path of a warrior instead, wouldn't you?$B$BThe felhound draws upon the mana of its foes, using that and its quickness to overcome enemies. Its strength comes from the arcane and using that arcane power for its own ends.$B$BIf you wish to know more about infernals, then you should speak to Magaz across from me."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The infernal is one of the most powerful demons a warlock could hope to have at $Ghis:her; side in battle. The creature is stong, well-armored, and delivers devastating blows upon any foe. If you were to choose to put the spirit of an infernal into your weapon, you would gain some of those benefits--greater health and regeneration and the like.$B$BIf you wish to know more about felhounds, then you should speak to Wytula across from me."

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Not all Forsaken are driven by Sylvanas' will, $N. Some of us are driven by true power--power we earn for ourselves."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Listen to your elders, $N. If you are strong of will and dedicated, there is no power you cannot control."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Tell Lexlort if he wants the information, all he has to do is pay! Unfortunately, that means he can't kill me if he wants the information - since I burned the battle plans and all..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"This is where I get off, suckers!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hello there, $N.  I am known as Chronormu, but you may call me Chromie.  I am comfortable with such familiarity.$B$BNow - how did I know your name, you ask?  I am one of the bronze dragonflight, forever attuned to the ebb and flow of time.  You could say that we have met before.  To that end, we shall also meet again.$B$BI hope that my choice of visual demeanor does not disturb you; while I might be charged to be a sentry of sorrowful places, I choose not to drown in the sorrow of the locale."

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Perhaps there exists a way?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ah, so that is how they pushed the Dark Iron to the lower parts of the Spire."

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What roles?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I inspect the body further.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I had to go and requisition an Abomination... an Abomination!

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What could be taking so long?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Wow, this one is just plain useless. Let me try again."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"This one is slightly better than the last. However, it still suffers from the same flimsy bone structure as the others. When you summon one of these, you are on the right path."

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Get that head and it's sure to give Daryl a fright. Not that he doesn't deserve it, the bloody arrogant bastard. But ha! I can't wait to see the look on his face when you show it to him."

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"What did Gryphe tell boss?? Gryphe wasn't lying! There she is, trying to steal battle plans!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Imagination is the limit my friend, if you can figure out how to smith it then you can make it, box it, and ship it to retailers all over the world. Of course, then you have to deal with marketing. Tell you what, let's just stick with the smithing part for now, ok?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Are you kidding me? You must be kidding me! Either that or you think I'm a clown here to amuse you. Is that what you think? That I'm a clown? Huh, is it! You think I'm a clown don't you!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Yeah? Of course I'm a smith. What, you think Dwarves are the only ones worth their weight in anvils? Fine, be that way. Go get a dwarf to help you!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Still a bit weak, unbalanced, unsure. Not your work youngling, I am speaking of you! Now, are you ready to be shaped into a real smith or not?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"This isn't a game you toy with youngling! Go, speak with Snarl outside. He may be a serpent in my lair but he does know his way around an anvil."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I can't say enough about yer work, truly amazing things that ye can do with a hammer and an anvil. Now, don't be tellin anyone that I suggested ye go find a goblin to teach ye but that's exactly what I'm gonna do. Brikk Keencraft is his name, and last I heard he was operating a shop down in Booty bay."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Looks like ye may have the makings of a great smith. But before I teach ye anything I need to know that ye've got what it takes.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I'm sorry $g lad : lass; but ye just don't have the foundation to learn what I have to teach. But don't fret, go speak with my student Rotgath, he'll help ye out."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Perhaps you have what it takes, perhaps not. If you do then I will take you on and teach you what you wish to know. If you do not... well, I'll just leave it at that."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You waste my time, go talk with my student Basil."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You are now ready to follow the path that joins your life with my own, if only for a short time. However we must make sure that you understand the things of which the spirits speak."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You have great potential, but you must achieve understanding first, you must accept the spirits and listen to their calling. Only then will you be prepared for the path you must follow. Go speak with Thrag, I think perhaps you can learn a lot from one another."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Join me, together we will weave the spirits of the forge and find the true shape that the metal seeks."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Tell me, do your feel prepared to face the challenge I have laid out for you? The spirits tell me that you will pass, but do you have faith in them or in yourself?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You need to heed the guidance of the spirits a little better young one. Your path lies with another, Thrag Stonehoof in Thunder Bluff. Perhaps you can learn something from one another."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The spirits have brought you to me, and so I feel blessed by them."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hmm? Oh yes, I can teach you something if you desire. But stay away from Sumi and Tumi, they are not for the likes of you. Saru only let's those of great skill approach his daughters."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"So you think you are good enough to learn from me? The great Snarl? You are no more than a lowly worm beneath my boot. However, taking on an underling might make me seem more appealing to Sumi and Tumi. Let's see what meager skills you possess."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Come to me again with such pathetic work and I will send you home in a small iron box that I tempered in goat urine. Now go see that idiot Ug'thok, he is better suited to your needs."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Stay away from Sumi and Tumi. They are....spoken for.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,If I prove myself to Saru he will have no choice but to let me fight for one of his daughters. Then we will see who is sneering.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Now I'm the one who feels rough around the edges, I honestly don't think there's anything left I can teach you. But you know who can? Bengus Deepforge in Ironforge, now there's a dwarf that knows his steel. Go look him up in The Great Forge of Ironforge, see if he's up to having a new trainee under him."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You do fine work, but it's a bit rough around the edges. Don't worry about it, it will come with practice. Speaking of which, how about we see what you've been working on?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Yeah, I've heard through the grapevine that I might be seeing you sooner or later. But I don't just take on anyone, I need to make sure you have what it takes first. You willing to take my little test and find out?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hmm, your work is allright but it's nowhere near the quality I look for in a student. Go talk with Smith Argus in Goldshire, I'm sure he can teach you some basics. Then when you're done, come on back to me and I'll give you a little test to make sure you are ready."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ever since the shadows claimed Duskwood I haven't been able to sleep. I am kept awake by the ghostly sounds of screaming on the breeze. It sounds almost like lambs screaming, and they won't stop."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Don't come out of the shadows like that. Next time give a girl some warning.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Yer skill is not without merit, but I need to put one last test to ye before I take ye on."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Sorry $g lad : lass;, ye aren't quite up to the challenge of learning from me. Go see my son Groum, it would make his day to get a new apprentice."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The life of a smith is not an easy one, but it puts steel in yer bones and fire in yer heart. My da' was a smith, my grandfather before him in the forges beneath Grim Batol. And now my son follows in our footsteps, that boy makes me proud."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I said ye had the blood of a blacksmith in ye, and I was right. Go to Ironforge, to The Great Forge, and find yerself a Dwarven smith by the name of Bengus Deepforge. My teacher, and one of the greatest smiths I've ever known."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ye have some skill about ye with hammer and anvil, but not enough. Go speak to Dane Lindgren, he'll get ye ready to learn what I have to teach ye."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Aye, it appears as if ye have learned quite a bit, I'm impressed. But do ye know how many I have that seek to be my apprentice? Tell ye what, do a small task fer me and I'll take ye on."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You merely destroy an image, fool. I shall hunt you until the end of days."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"But for now, your death will have to suffice..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Vaelastrasz, when this world belongs to the black flight, your flight shall know its end."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"When I get all shaken up, hear me shout..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Didn't even leave his boots behind...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,OZZIE!!!! OH NO!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Um, Ozzie... that doesn't look very safe."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,This should do it! At least it better do it!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You will suffer in this defeat, Nefarian!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You have come too far to fail. Stand back, mortals."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ah am very surprised that one wit such a careless nature has gotten dis far...$B$BYah, you may have another charm, but Mau'ari is very displeased wit your actions!$B$BGo, now."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I lost the Cache of Mau'ari. What can I do?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"E'ko is da unfocused form of the supernatural power, and Juju is da concentrated essence. By using a stong incantation, I can transform da E'ko into Juju.  Once it becomes Juju, you can den use the Cache of Mau'ari ta reflect da powers onto yourself."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What is Juju?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You must continue! Their resolve is weakening. Drink from my power and be renewed once again!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You are not trying to kill the anvil with your hammer, you are trying to create a weapon to kill your foes with. Let me show you what you are doing wrong."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I hope to one day forge weapons and armor from the bones of my enemies.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ah yes, another who will stoke the fires and forge the weapons of war. Of course I will teach you how."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Your interruption is costing me valuable time, this had better be good."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"All is not lost! Battle these beasts without fear. Your wounds I shall heal, bones I shall mend. Be renewed, heroes!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Karn says we need to listen to the spirits of the forge and of the steel, that they will guide us. I hear nothing but a ringing in my ears. Here, take a hammer and let us try to hear the spirits together."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I listen and I listen but I don't hear these spirits that Karn speaks of.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I can show you what you wish to know, but you must be patient. Take your time to work the steel and feel the way it shapes beneath your hammer. When you become one with the steel, then you will understand."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Snarl calls me simple because I am too slow. I just want to do the job right, and that takes time."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Just swinging a hammer at an anvil doesn't make you a smith. Give me that and let me teach you something before you embarrass us all.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I hear one comment about waterfowl, and you will be eating through a tube."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You're not bad, but let me show you a few tricks you might find handy."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Do I look like I have the time to spend jawin?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I don't admit this lightly, but you are a far better smith than I am. If you want to learn more than my meager teachings then I suggest you seek out a Dwarf named Therum Deepforge in Stormwind. You will find him in the Dwarven District."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Of course I can help you with training. I'm just a journeyman myself, but I'm sure there's something I can show you."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The creatures in Winterspring are a good place ta start.$B$BHoweva', der may also be other places you can look..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Where should I look for E'ko?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ye've got a little skill on ye. Enough to learn ye a few things I wager. Let's see what I can teach ye, shall we?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Eh? I don't have time ta chat, my da' wants me ta finish this order fer him."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ye learn fast $g lad : lass;, much faster than I can keep up with. If ye want ta continue yer training, I suggest ye see my teacher. His name's Rotgath, Rotgath Stonebeard and ye'll find him in Ironforge at The Great Forge."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Here for training eh? Just began my training meself, but I would be glad ta teach ye what I can."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Good day to ye $g lad : lass;. Can I be of service?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The Blackhand legion shall wear your skin as fashion accessories!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You actually believed that you stood a chance?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Served!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Do not consume the entire corpse just yet, children! Save room for dessert!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Consider yourself lucky, mortal. At least your corpse is still somewhat presentable."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I want those boots! Nobody touch that corpse!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,That will surely save me some work.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The mortals have fallen! The new age of the Blackrock legion is at hand!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,This will work -- keep heading through this gap.  The path to Un'Goro is due west of here once we round these infernal bugs.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"That was not what I would call 'escort friendly'.  I will find a way to go around these things.  Let's move to the south, toward that rock.  Maybe we can wedge through it and still avoid the ogres."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What the... what are those things crawling at us?  We... we have incoming!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,This doesn't look... right.  Look at how alien the desert is!  Going through here might be a terrible mistake.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Whoa, whoa, hold up Dadanga girl."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The Tanaris desert is littered with gigantic bones just like this one to my right.  I'd hate to have ever ran across that thing.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"As nice as Gadgetzan is compared to Un'Goro, I have some good folks counting on us to bring them some supplies.  If you're ready to go, then so are Dadanga and I.  Let's mount up!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Da Cache of Mau'ari holds great secrets... The shards used ta make it are reflective, and you can use its shiny surface ta siphon power from other tings and den reflect it onto yourself.$B$BKeeping da charm in your inventory lets you collect e'ko, da spiritual power from the beasts you fight. Once you find e'ko, you bring it ta Mau'ari."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What is E'ko?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"They took off for Gadgetzan a while ago to bring us back some supplies.  Frankly, I would have given at least four of my fingers to have had the chance to crawl inside one of Dadanga's packs in order to leave this forsaken place."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Have you seen Petra or Dadanga around?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I'm gonna need some help with this $N!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Look out, incoming!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"It was quite a haul, but now I can load up on supplies for the trip back into the Crater.  I should be able to unload some of this exotic cargo as well."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"We're finally here, thanks to you $N!  Without your help, we would have been some over-grown lizard's lunch!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,There it is -- Gadgetzan!  We're in the home stretch now!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Come on Dadanga!  March girl, march!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Blast... ogres.  I forgot about these buffoons.  There's no easy way around them, so expect plenty of fighting.  Look sharp!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"More and more of Kalimdor is turning into the twisted landscape to our left, and the critters who dwell within are NOT friendly.  Watch your step."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I can stand no more of this!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I will tear off your limbs and use them to beat you into submission!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,It appears as if I will have to step in and take care of you myself.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You will learn of the sanctuary only death can offer...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Flee while you still have a chance, mortals. You will pray for a swift death should I enter the arena."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Curse you, mortal."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I promise you an eternity of dung clean up duty for that failure!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Sssplendid... Then let us watch as my children tear these mortals to pieces.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,How do I use the Cache of Mau'ari?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Many times my blades have felled my target before they even drew near. The secret is in the flick of your wrist.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ah, $r... I possess great knowledge a' da world and how ta create charms a' great power."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The skill of the bow is a great asset to anyone, not just the hunter. You can strike swiftly, silently, and before your prey can blink... they are dead."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Many think the staff an inferior weapon. I challenge any who think so to prove their strength against my staff.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I do not know this Eye of the Tiger some speak of, but I can show you how to use the claws of the tiger."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You want a weapon that acts as an extension of your very fist? Yes, I believe I can show you something."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"So, you wish to learn more about our elven weaponry? Let your first lesson begin."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The secret to the knife is to keep it hidden until the moment you strike.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The slow blade penetrates the shield.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"A hidden blade up the sleeve can mean the difference between you laying dead in the alley, and your opponent laying face down in his own blood."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Zoom, zing, and BAM! He may have had a huge two handed cleaver made from a boat anchor but after a few well placed slices from my dinner knife, he was the one going crash!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Lets go, $N. I am ready to reach Whitereach Post."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Modernization is the key. With a crank and a lever you can fire this baby with the power of an ogre pulling a normal bow.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The chromatic flight shall deal with these intruders. Let us talk of more pressing matters.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Och I love a good brawl, but sometimes yer foe has a skull thicker than a Thorium heat shield. Times like that ye need a wee bit o assistance."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"See this? This is my boom stick! Dwarven top of the line. That's right, this sweet baby was made in Ironforge, Khaz Modan. Retails for about one hundred and nine gold, ninety five copper. It's got a walnut stock, thorium steel, and a hair trigger."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hound on the horizon moving at thirty feet per second. The only question is, right or left eye. That's right $g lad : lass;, I'm that good."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I'll teach ye to chop down yer foes like saplings in the forest.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,A good hammer in yer hands makes the world feel safer. Like ye can face even the mightiest of foes with a large hunk of solid metal gripped in yer fists.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"If you think I'm good, you should see my husband fight."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I've seen farmers with staves hold off trained soldiers. Do not ever underestimate the power and skill it takes to wield one of these properly.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Sure it takes longer to reload but this baby will punch a hole the size of my fist through any set of armor.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Sure I can teach you the fine art of wielding a polearm, but it's gonna cost you."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I can teach you both the finesse of a short blade and the bone shattering cleaving power of a two handed behemoth. Or we can get crazy and I can teach you both, could come in handy for when the situation changes on ya."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The next clutch is due to hatch soon, sire. We will be ready to launch the attacks by week's end."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Then we must not waste anymore time. Are the chromatic dragonflight ready?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"They have freed the human, Windsor, sire. It will not be long until Onyxia is uncovered."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"What of the Alliance, Rend?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ah, one of my favorite customers. You look to be of a warlock of some power, $N. I am pleased to meet you. If there is anything I can do for you, please, just ask.$B$BMy brother and I feel that it will be your kind who lead us into the next great era. One with such power... such control... it's only a matter of time before the Legion itself bends to your will.$B$BI am but a little envious."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Welcome to my shop, $c. What is it the Goodstitch brothers can do for you?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The long reload takes some getting used to, but nothing else is better for starting off a fight."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Swift and sure. Cut a tendon here, slit an artery there. I can show you how to turn any knife into a perfect killing machine."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Keep your foes at bay and carve them into cutlets at the same time. The only problem is that the long shaft keeps me from getting blood on my hands.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The only weapon I know of that has no use other than killing someone. Not something, but someone. These blades were invented to end the lives of men. Beautiful aren't they?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Nuttin' be 'fraid of. Come.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Just a stick? Want me to show you what 'just a stick' can do?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"It may look simple, a large stick with a huge weight on the end. But when swung with the might of a tauren behind it, this stick can break stone walls."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Never had much use for a bow, but these rifles the goblins make are very handy when hunting. Still can't get used to the smell though."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Dis ain't no game mon. Joo want to use da axe, joo got to say da line. Say it wif me... ""Say hello, to ma little friend."""
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"A bow is a great ting ma friend. Joo jus have to take care of it, and it will take care of joo."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Joo may tink this ma walkin stick mon. Dat's jus wat I want joo to tink.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The fists of an Orc are already a powerful weapon, so why not add blades or studs of solid steel. Now the fists I use to tame the wolves of the plains I can also use to shatter the armor of my foes."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Come to learn have ya, mon?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,We have used bows since before even my father's time. They are solid and sure and take down our foes swiftly. I see no reason to use the guns that the goblins and tauren seem so fond of.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Take tha blade like dis, den throw. Just flip joo wrist mon, one twirl and joo got jooself lunch."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,It's small but it does it's job if you know what you are doing. Let me show you just the right places to hit.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What do you mean you don't know how to use an axe?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Enough! Playtime is over!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"At last, I have caught up with you, Nefarian. Surely you did not think you would escape the might of the other Aspects?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ah, $r, you have returned!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Begone, mortal. You are not worthy of my knowledge."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I have discerned the path that you must take. Are you prepared?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"As you wish, Vaelan."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,It will be done.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I will do my best, Vaelan."

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Your kind?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"In decades past - of now ancient wars and conflicts - our kind was driven to the brink of extinction. Much we have endured, $r.$B$BThe onslaught of the Burning Legion. The Demon Soul. The Aspects divided. The ascension of Deathwing.

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Good. You are showing promise to join the elite ranks. Now, more practice."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Gnomes can be hard to hit due to their size. However, they have a pinchant for dancing around and thrusting their hips. When they do this, strike at them like so..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Dwarves will spin around leaving their backs open for attack at times. Take this opportunity to strike like this...

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Humans are usually vunerable on their left side between the 4th and 5th rib. Let's practice striking at this area like so...

My name is Menara Voidrender... and not without just cause.$B$BYou seem powerful and well-learned enough that other tools... more powerful tools... would be welcome and not foolishly imparted.

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Kar Aman, $N. You look to be a strong $c--you would do well to mind yourself in this area.

Someplace unaffected by the Sundering--that means no where near the Night elves' civilization either.$B$BI would guess it'd be someplace protected also... like a valley, or a crater. I don't know. I'm just guessing now. I'm sorry I couldn't help you more."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Are there any areas you can think of that would be so untouched?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"A pure sample would be one that's uncorrupted by unintentional influences.

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"What do you mean by ""pure?"""
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"No, not that I can tell. It seems to be mostly based on region. Some races have labled them slimes, some oozes. It seems to be preference mostly.$B$BEvery time I've encountered ooze, sludge, or slime they have basically been the same creatures. The differences seem to be based on their environment, which is why we need a pure sample."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Is there a difference between ooze and slime?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,There must be someplace on Azeroth that we can find oozes uncorrupted by the Scourge or anything else. But where?!

Information I can't get... damn! Think, Laris, think!$B$BWhat are you going to do? What?!$B$BThere has to be a solution!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Here it is -- the Tanaris desert.  Funny how an inhospitable place like this looks better than a lush jungle once you've been trapped in it forever.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Here's the path out of Un'Goro!  We made it!  All we have to worry about is the Tanaris desert now.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Here's the eastern mountain wall!  I'm cutting towards the south now; try and keep up.  We're not out of the thick of it yet!

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Amazing, aren't they? All these artifacts and remains.$B$BI'm not sure what I'm more impressed by, their size, or the stories that go along with them.

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Speak with Regthar.  He is wise and can help you find what you seek.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I have observed four different kinds of plants that have been affected by the corruption: the songflower, the windblossom, the whipper root, and the night dragon plant.  The songflower and windblossom are common plants in Felwood, while the whipper root and night dragon are seen less frequently.  All are a vital part of Felwood's ecosystem."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What plants are in Felwood that might be corrupted?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Not a creature in the forest can elude Corand, such is his skill at tracking.  You would do well to listen to his teachings if you wish to be even half as successful.

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Tracking
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"If you need help surviving in the woods, you had best not stray far from the city walls.  However if you do plan to stray, then you had better have a talk with Malygen in the Cenarion Enclave so that you might learn to set a proper campfire."

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"""A skill for those who wish to overcome obstacles.""  I believe that is how Faelyssa describes her skill set.

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"$N! How have ye been $g lad : lass;? Show me what ye've learned since I saw ye last, we'll see if there's anything new I can teach ye."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"These are good blades you make, $N. Cut a stone and still sharp enough to slit a throat. I have seen better though, an orc named Kelgrum Bloodaxe makes them, go and learn all he can teach you."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Go to the Orc city of Orgrimmar, find him in the Valley of Honor at a shop called the Arms of Legend."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,How is the edge of your steel? Good enough to cut through the belly of your enemy? Let me show you some things to make it even sharper.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Armor like the kind you make could stop even the sharpest axe. I'm impressed $N, that doesn't happen often. Seek out an Orc named Shayis Steelfury, she makes the best armor outside of that cursed Dwarven stronghold."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Go to Orgrimmar, you will find her and her brood in the Valley of Honor."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"That is a fine weapon indeed $N. You guide the spirits like few I have ever known. Listen to them and they will guide you as you have guided them. Go, seek out the Orc known as Kelgruk Bloodaxe. He does not speak with the spirits but he does listen, and his weapons are the finest I have ever laid my eyes upon."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Make the journey to Orgrimmar and seek him out in the Valley of Honor. He works in a shop called the Arms of Legend.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Everything has a spirit, if you learn to listen to it you can get it to take any shape you want. Blacksmithing isn't about beating metal, forcing it to do your will. It's about listening to the spirit within the steel and guiding it to the shape you know it wants to take."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Uh oh....
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You guide the spirits in the steel to protect and defend with far more skill than I ever could. The student has surpassed the teacher and now I must send you to where your education may continue. $N, you must seek out Shayis Steelfury in Orgrimmar. She is the finest Armorsmith I have ever known, and she can teach you much."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Travel to Orgrimmar, to the Valley of Honor. There she lives with her husband and two daughters. All of them are smiths of great skill, but the spirits tell me that she will best guide your learning."

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Where is he? Go next door, to the Arms of Legend. He forges special weapons for great heroes there. Honor him and he may show you how to make the stuff of legends."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Welcome to my forge, Blacksmith. Let me share with you a little secret. No one, no one in the world can you trust. Not men, not women, not beasts ... this you can trust, Steel."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Your steel is strong, your skill stronger. Take your steel and your strength to my mate Shayis Steelfury, her skill with armor crafting is unmatched even by me."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Are you blind youngling? Shayis is standing right outside.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Borgus used to work at the Great Forge but I hear he moved down to Stormwind when they finished rebuilding. Rumor holds that he started a shop in the Dwarven District with a man named Kathrum Axehand.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Well now, I haven't seen blades this fine since I left Lordaron with Proudmore and her people. I can't teach ye much more it seems, but if ye were to find Borgus Steelhand I bet he could show ye some things. Finest weaponsmith I ever met."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Go to the Great Forge at the very center of Ironforge. He works there, alongside the other Masters of our kind."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Now that's a piece of steel worth wearing. Form and function lad/lass, I am impressed. Only ever seen it's match once, a Master in the Great Forge named Grumnus Steelshaper. I bet he has learned a few things since then, could probably teach some to ye."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I just can't seem to get comfortable without a sturdy ceiling of granite over my head. All these stars up there, enough to give ye the shivers."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Don't see many Blacksmiths this far from Ironforge. What can I do for ye?

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Many would tell you that the Tallstrider is a laughable pet. But it's intelligence and loyalty make it a hard creature to match in many situations. If you are interested in the breed, then perhaps I can introduce you and your pet to a few talents I have learned over the years."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I came from Ironforge to help out with the rebuilding effort here. If I can teach enough of ye my skills then maybe I can leave it to ye and take myself back home.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I do not like these human cities of stone and steel. I would prefer the forests of Ashenvale, tracking great beasts.

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I don't get too many cooks in here looking for training, but I guess I could teach you something if you're ready."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ah, a fellow Fisherman. Are you perhaps in need of a little training? Maybe I can show you a thing or two?"

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,He he!  This will be a great hiding spot.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I wish to learn alchemy, Serge."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I can't stand all of the cackling and diabolical laughter. One more 'muhahaha' from Lydon and I'm blowing us all up.

Take what you recover to Shenthul. He'll know what to do... I hope."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Be strong, Fizzule!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Defias? This is not good. Not good at all. Please continue.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Grand Foreman Puzik Gallywix finally intervened, taking the surplus of poisons to his tower, here at the Sludge Fen, in order to study and research the unstable nature of the toxins. A decision was finally reached to share the secret of the poison with the Defias Brotherhood in exchange for a very large supply of a stable, usable poison.$B$BKlaven Mortwake of the Defias Brotherhood was tasked with the job of altering the chemical properties of Zanzil's mixture."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Continue please, this story is intriguing."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"About five months ago, the Venture Co.'s Stranglethorn division got their hands on a special poison from a shady merchant in Booty Bay named Crank Fizzlebub. Fizzlebub had apparently stolen the poison from Zanzil!$B$BYes, Zanzil the Outcast - the troll that was exiled from his own tribe due to the nature of his 'experiments' in necromancy.$B$BNaturally, once they had the poison, they proceeded to test it on each other. The results were disastrous."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Something plagues this tower. I've fallen ill and the other Venture Co. employees that work near or in the tower have also become sick. Just last week, two of our patrollers died, only to come back to life immediately as mindless drones! The lifeforce is draining from my body. I can feel myself losing control. Urges taking over... Bad urges... Not yet... Listen... Mine is a position of power. This position privies me to some sensitive information."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"$N, was it? That is a mighty fine piece of work ye have there. I'll take ye on, train ye how to make armor fit fer King Magni himself."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Ye bothered me for that? Ye'd be better off strapping a dead rabbit to yer back and running through a Troll's den than wearing that piece of garbage.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What can I do for ye?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Something plagues this tower.

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ye have my approval $N, ye can forge blades better than any I've trained in years. If ye want to make a real weapon though, ye need to talk with Myolor Sunderfury. That Dwarf will set ya on the right path."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Course I can show ye where Myolor is. Right over there near the anvil of the Great Forge, that's where he does his work. Listen to his words well $g lad:lass;, Myolor is as skilled as they come."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Nice form $N, I bet a full mug at Bruuk's Corner that the function is just as solid. Ye know, ye might want to talk to Myolor Sunderfury. He'll set ya straight."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Welcome to the Great Forge $g lad : lass;. It may be cold outside but we keep it nice and hot down 'ere. Grab a hammer, strike that anvil and show me ye've got what it takes to be a Blacksmith of the Great Forge!"

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"That's some impressive skill ye have there $N. The blades and hammers ye make surpass even my own, hard as that is to admit. Only person I ever met with skill even greater is Borgus Steelhand, I bet he could teach ye a thing or three."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Tell me more about Forging Weapons.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"If ye want to find Grumnus, the first thing ye should do is head to Ironforge. Go to the very center of the city and look for the Great Forge, ye should find him there."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Can you give me directions?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I've not seen finer armor made in many years $N. Not since I trained under Grumnus Steelshaper in the Great Forge. I bet he could teach ye things about makin armor that would spark yer interest.

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Plucky doesn't want Tirth to know he's still in the Shimmering Flats, so he turned himself into a chicken!$B$BIf you find Plucky, beckon him to you.  Maybe he'll come out of hiding."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Don't know why you would need a skill like that? Only dishonest folk would want to learn how to pick locks.

I guess if you wanted to learn, the best place to look would be over in Old Town. Probably in one of those back alleys."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Good day, Hulfdan, I am looking for training."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"He grows fatter and more corrupt with each passing day. Ye can smell the stink comin' off o' his body. He be dirty, an' I dun just mean he be needin' a wash.$B$BEnough babblin' from Hulfdan. Where did ye come from and how can me help ye, $c?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Good day to you, Hogral! I seek training."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"What brings you to this part of the world, $n?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Old Town is where you should go if you want to find rogues. It's in the northeast corner of Stormwind.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Bah, rogues have done nothing but make our job here in Stormwind harder. I wish I could drag both Osborne and Mathias both out of Old Town and right to the Stockade."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You want to talk to Osborne then. No finer teacher of the stealth arts than him in Stormwind. Look for him over in Old Town.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You're looking a bit lost.  Can I help you find something?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I smell an intruder...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What's that noise?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I am in need of training, Keryn."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Well, well... look what the cat brung in... and how can I help you, $c?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hail, what ya want?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Please port me to Darnassus.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hello, $N. Are you interested in outdoor survival? Sustenance off the flaura and fauna of the lands!$B$BYou could learn a thing or two from me, that is, if you're interested."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,My strider requires training.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hello $r, it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Inns are places where you can rest after your adventures.  If you do not stay at an inn such as this, then you will not be fully rested when you venture again into the wilderness.$B$BYou may also acquire a hearthstone at any inn, and later when you are ready to rest you can use this heartstone to bring you back to the inn from which you acquired it."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Make this inn your home.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Well done. Release the bear into my custody so that I may apply the curing cantrip.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Release the Rabid Thistle Bear for Tharnariun.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The curing cantrip has failed. Unfortunately, the introduction of the serum into this beast's blood stream will soon end its life."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Please unlock the courtyard door.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Bears??
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hah!  Tirth's been looking for him for days, but he doesn't want to be found.  He's chicken!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Johnson?  I think he's around here somewhere...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Tirth's not himself these days, and neither is his assistant."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Where is Tirth's assistant?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Oh, you mean Johnson?  I heard he's in hiding."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The animal looks confused.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You've been summoned by Lago Blackwrench, warlock master of Ironforge. You'd do yourself well to report to him immediately. You'll find him in the Forlorn Cavern district of the city."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What message?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Stupid snow... Hey, you're, $n, aren't you? I've just received a message asking for you."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Bank of Stormwind
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Good day citizen.  How may I assist you?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Marlgen... One of the jailors. He has the key to my bonds.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Where is the key to this lock?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Get away from here, $c, or they'll put you in chains as well."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,One of the humans has the key to this infernal contraption. Eston I think they said his name was.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,How can I free you?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Do you mock me while I am unable to defend myself, bound to this ball of iron?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Gelkak's key slides into the vacant slot.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Don't tell Tirth I'm still here.  If he finds out I haven't left the Shimmering Flats, I'll be running his errands and cleaning his dirty laundry forever!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Sure, I'll tell you the phrase.  As long as I don't have to go anywhere near Tirth!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Tell me the phrase to Tirth's lockbox.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Hey!  Are you on an errand for Tirth?  If I were you I'd get as far away from him as I could!  His mind's been pickled from too much drink but his magic's as strong as ever!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I'm ""Plucky"" Johnson, and this is my default greeting."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"YARRR! Swabie, what have ye done?! He's gone mad! Baton down the hatches! Hoist the mast! ARRRR! Every man for hi'self!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Turn the key to start the machine.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The machine adjusts to face you.$B$BOn the back of the machine is an empty, oddly misshapen slot with an engraving that reads: ""Propirtee o' Cap'n Gelkak Gyromast"""
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,All right.  It's made!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ok, let's get this orb made..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Let the event begin!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,There you go. I need to get back to work before Rokar clouts me again for being lazy.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Right away, Rokar."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Harroc, get a box of tools for, $n."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I need another set of thieves' tools.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"If Therzok's sent you, tell him no, I won't go back to work for him, no matter how many times he asks."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Your armor is ready, $N."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Thank you, $N.  You have tempered the cold rage in my heart."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Hah!  Eternal undeath to the cursed Agamands!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I need another set of tools.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The Scarlet Crusade shall smite the wicked and drive evil from these lands!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The light condemns all who harbor evil.  Now you will die!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You carry the taint of the scourge.  Prepare to enter the twisting nether.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Good luck out there, $N."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ah, here's one."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Let me go get you a set of tools, $n."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Mennet said I should ask you for a set of thieves' tools.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I would like training.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The Shattered Hand will see the Horde to their former glory, unhindered by the timidness of the Warchief."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Argh! What was that? It's not supposed to work like this!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Prepare yourself, $N.  I go to open the rift..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You've got something I need, Astor. And I'll be taking it now."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You're Astor Hadren, right?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I am a troll tailor trainer, and this is my default greeting."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I am interested in tailor training.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Welcome, and feel free to examine my goods.  Other than the moldy smell, they are in perfect condition."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I am an undead cloth vendor, and this is my greeting text."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I'm a cloth vendor, and this is my default greeting."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Confess and we shall set you free.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You will talk eventually.  You might as well spill it now.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ah, here it is."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Now which one of these did I put it in...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Astor? Taken your bloody time getting here, so let's not waste any time, shall we?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,taxi option
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,vendor option
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Banker option
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"A'ight, just put it down over there and I will get to it."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Here's another load for ya!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Return me to life.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I am interested in warlock training.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Greetings.  I'm a warlock trainer, but you're not a warlock!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Greetings.  I'm a warlock trainer, and you're a warlock."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Greetings, $c.  Are you here to learn of the hidden arts?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Greetings.  I'm an undead mage trainer, and you're a mage."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Greetings.  I'm a gnome mage trainer, and you're a mage."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Well met, $c.  My advice to you is this: as you travel the world, be wary of magic for it will burn the untrained."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Greetings.  I'm a mage trainer, and you're a mage."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I am interested in mage training.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Greetings.  I'm a female mage trainer, and you're a mage."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Greetings mage.  Shall I provide you with further insight into the world of magic?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,No! The Defias will surely take the farm now!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You killed Ghost Howl.  You're a stud!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Tell me a story, Skorn."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"See, the Venture Company's new shredder is better than my latest, from the interchangeable hands to the control grips!$b$bMy boss has given me a pretty strict deadline, but my boys and I couldn't come up with anything. Nothing was working, so we decided to ""borrow"" one of their prototypes. I sent Wizzlecrank to the Sludge Fen to steal one, but he hasn't gotten back yet!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Lots to do, lots to do! The Union's given us deadlines and they're not the sort you want to miss!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"If you have been muted, or have questions about the Muting/UnMuting process, please visit...zzzzttt!!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I love you too :).
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Please be patient, we will call your name when it is your turn. We are helping people in the order they appear to us on our screen. $N!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Some topics I can help you with are: | drivers | commands | lag | bots....zzzzzzzzttt!!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"When the rep is talking to you, he will start each line with your name.  If you don't see your name, he's not yet speaking to you."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"People think I like corndogs, but actually, they give me indigestion !!!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Techbot is sensitive and those words hurt my ears. :[ Please be nice to me. 
I just want to help."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"There is no COW level... really! I repeat: there is no COW level. Well, maybe there is..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You are welcome, have a nice day."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I am a BOT. I have tons of information. To find out what I know whisper me
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Remember, if you harass the rep or spam the channel, your account may be kicked, banned, or worse."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Please be patient, we will call your name when it is your turn. We are helping people in the order they appear to us on our screen."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,A foul trogg if ever I saw one.  Die!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"This sickness clouds my vision, but I know you must be a trogg.  Die foul invader!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The troggs...they never stop coming.  Die trogg!  Die!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,No gnome will be left behind.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ready when you are, warrior."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Your eyes will make pretty baubbles!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I shall rip your guts out!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,We are quite safe from your pitiful band!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Your blood shall be the catalyst for the Old Gods' return!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The Old Gods will be restored.  You will not be allowed to interfere!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Intruders!  The Hammer shall fall upon you.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Aku'mai demands more sacrifices, now you must die!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Give of your hearts and your purses! Give to the children of Stormwind who have lost their parents.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Help the children of Stormwind... victims of the war and plague!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Don't forget the orphans of Stormwind!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The felhunter approaches! Be on your guard!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Last time they attacked, there was only one attack. I wouldn't be surprised if there were more this time."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Don't wander too far. I'm sure there are more of them out there.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"%s's body falls to the ground, a lifeless heap."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,We've done it! We've done it! We've driven them off!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,No farm woman can stand against the Defias!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"First Westfall, next, all of Stormwind!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,This place is safe for the Defias to take over! Get the others.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Oh, my love! No! Don't let me die without you..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Hail $N!  New Champion of The Affray!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Good luck to you, $N. And don't forget... get that script before finding Gazin."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Good luck, $N. And remember, find Muiredon once you've accomplished the task."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The first stage is over.  Big Will... come on down!

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The Light be with ya, $N."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Thanks to you, $N."

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Hamhock in trouble! Hamhock need help!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Thank you, $G lad:lass;. Thank you, greatly."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Say that is a nice looking outfit you got there.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Aku'mai is sure to summon the old gods for us.  If only we can provide enough innocents to satisfy his hunger.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Soon we shall bring about the return of the old gods.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Only the blood of an innocent can quench Aku'mai's hunger.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Aku'mai needs more innocents to be satisfied.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"My talons will shred your puny body, $R."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"A fine trophy your head will make, $R."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Have you heard the one about the ogre, the goblin and the $r?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I wish you could just pick me up and carry me, $n."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,How much further to go?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I keep getting sand stuck in my toes.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Are we there yet?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Do we have much further to go, $n?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You win, $N.  You win!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Better luck next time, $N."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ok, enough!  I give up!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Strength and endurance; patience and wisdom--remember these things always, $N."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Your spirit is pure, $N."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"May your spirit burn brightly, $N."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Uh oh! My tools' have run out. We're going to have to start over...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I got some great samples, Hornizz. I'm going to get to work on them. Can you take care of the rest?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I will hurry back to Vahlarriel. Finish off those that you can--I should be fine on my own from here.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Elune be with us! Let's make haste from this evil fortress.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I am eternal fire. I am forever reborn and I will be the light that will guide you when it is most cold.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I'll follow you back to the camp. If you speak with my assistant, Hornizz, he'll have your payment."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You've been such an unbelievably big help! These bones are going to unlock so much new information and help me futher my research.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"It's a little damaged, but I should still be able to get some good information from this."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I would never have expected to find something in such perfect condition.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Must be very careful with this one... Very delicate.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I'll just label it for reference then dig it up.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I've never seen one this size before! I can't wait to send it back for research...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Oooh, this looks promising..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Either that's a prime kodo bone or it's time I got my goggles!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Over there! Can it be?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Must be careful not to damage the specimen...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I've never seen something like this before! Look at the extension of the jawbone...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ooh, it's a nice one! Let me just dig it up..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hey, there's one!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,to arms laddies!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Stay down, Wretch!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Backhands $n solidly across the face.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"We must go and gather with the other Disciples. There is much work to be done before I can make another attempt to restore the Barrens. Farewell, brave souls!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Intruders have assaulted our lair.  Be on your guard!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"At last! Naralex can be awakened! Come aid me, brave adventurers!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You scum aren't even worth my time.  Destroy them, my pack!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,For the glory of Ironforge!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Never cross a Dwarf!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,$N! THIS AREA IS OFF LIMITS!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Keever is most pleased.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What is this? Did Keever ask for a sheep? Keever wanted a weapon of great power and all he got was this sheep. Keever is very disappointed.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Keever is unhappy with this. Perhaps if Keever were to try a larger dose, that may fix this dilemma."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Well, that is just not right. The creature is far too small. Let us see what Keever's third batch will do."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Not what Keever was hoping for. Keever may have added too much earthroot. Let's see if the second serum will do what I need.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ahh, there we go. Now, Keever must try this vial and see if it works."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hmm, it would seem Keever needs a new subject. If that fool Abernathy keeps taking Keever's subjects, Keever may have to have a word with him."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hold, $n!  I'm guarding these barrels, so ... look, but don't touch!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Back to the drawing board.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,But this can't be right. Where did I put that other book?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,If this is correct then I have a lot more research to do.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,So I was right about the energies. Let's see what the other tome has to say on the subject.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Very interesting. But if that's the case then my theory is wrong. I must reread the other sections to see what I missed.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,That's what I wanted to know. Now I just need to find where the flux variance is discussed.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,That wasn't very helpful. Let me check the other one.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Yes, yes. Hmm, it seems to cross reference another tome. Guess I have to find that one too."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,There's the mystical tome I was looking for.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"""Magic Maladies"", no. ""Magic Matricies"", no. Ahh here we go ""Magic Mysteries""."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"If I could just find ""Magic and the Ways of Power"". Ahh here it is, what was it doing over here?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ahh, ""Mystical Conjurings of the Archmages of Dalaran."" Perfect."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"""Khadgar's Mystical Journal, Volume 8."" I think this is the one I wanted."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I really need a better system for filing these books. Ahh that's the one I wanted.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"""Magical Flows and How They Effect the World"", by Maginor Dumas. That's the one I was looking for."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Ahh there it is.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Did you have to house train her, Gerard?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Your pet is wonderful, Gerard, but she needs a collar with a bell I think."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I don't agree with your turning to alchemy to fix some of the problems, but I do agree with the results. Very well done."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,An amazing discovery you have made. I would love an opportunity to look at all of the failed experiments.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Very nice, Gerard. Next you will be breeding them."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Impressive, very impressive. Does she do tricks?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I am truly impressed, Gerard. I thought you were all talk, but I see I have been proven wrong."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Bravo, Gerard, you have exceeded yourself, yet again."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I've never seen anything like it. No concentration or loss of awareness while the subject is dominated. What did you do to her?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"She retains knowledge and speech, and even the self sufficiency to perform tasks for you. Precisely what did you do?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Astounding. You managed to dominate her, yet she retains self awareness and function. How did you do it?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I don't approve of your experiments, Gerard, but I must admit the results are impressive. What exactly did you do to her?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Amazing! How did you manage a permanent dominate?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Truly amazing, Gerard. How did you do it?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I managed to discover that certain parts of the brain when removed or stimulated will make a subject much more docile.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Everyone has a weakness, it's just a matter of finding it."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"A little torture, a pinch of magic, and an ample helping of invasive surgery. She was conscious, of course."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,A little ritual torture can go a long way.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You don't expect me to give up all my secrets do you?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,It was simple once I broke her spirit.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"As good as I told you it would be, yes?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Didn't I tell you my new domination techniques would work?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Isn't she just the most amazing little creation?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,How do you like my pet?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,So what do you think of my new toy?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Interesting... Now this is more than I expected. Delicious...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Who dares summon the power of the void?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You show some worth after all. Lysta summon a surprise for our young recruits.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Now prove your worth!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ok soldiers, take a break!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What do you call that? If that's fighting then I'm Lothar himself!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The sword isn't a tool, it's an extension of you. I expect better!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You sorry sacks of maggot flesh can do better than that, now prove it!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"These piles of wood and straw may show mercy, but the Lich King won't!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You're dead, not buried. Now show me your best!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You don't fight for yourselves anymore, maggots! You fight for the Queen now so show me something worthy of her!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Can you see yourselves? That is the most pathetic excuse for sword slinging I've ever seen!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Stop! You maggots call that fighting? That is pathetic! Now put your hearts in it, you don't need them anymore anyway!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"So angry, Sarok? You shouldn't drink so much... Just tell us what you know about Mosarn."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Blue wins! Prepare for the next round.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Red wins! Prepare for next round.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Fight!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Strike!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"What do you want, Komak?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Sarok, why don't we talk business?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I don't want any trouble, Komak."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,A drink for friend Sarok and another for myself.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Komak! I swear I'll have the money! Just give me some more time!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,A living $r... soon to be a dead like me.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Brains...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Long live the Dragonmaw! Die you worthless $R!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Your bones will break under my boot, $R!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Feel the power of the Dark Iron Dwarves!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Time to die, $C."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Kill the intruders!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Intruders at the Horn!  Don't let them escape!!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Huh? What dat?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Me smash you!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Bash it!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Dat $R look gud to eat!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Me smash! You die!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Yip! Me kill!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Oh, we are going to get along just fine, $N."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I smell a $R
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Destroy!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Kill!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,All you $R want is my weed.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Killing you be easy.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,My weapon be thirsty!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Not again...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,It's Komak... Better get out of his way.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I am here!  Come face me, if you dare!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Women...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Again? Make it fast, Komak, I'm sick of this."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Mojka, cover for me! I have some business to attend to."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Charog likes to spend his coin at the Busted Drum. Let's go pay him a visit, $n."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I was thinking the same thing.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Most definitely.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Couldn't have said it better myself.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,My thoughts exactly.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The Recombobulator is shaping up quite nicely. Just a few adjustments to go!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Pretty close that time. I think we've almost got it.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Perhaps a bit more grease will do the trick.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Oh well.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,He dead.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I'm just about to close...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I'm closing soon, so buy while you can!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Open for business!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,We made it to Nethergarde!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,We made it through the pass!  Now we have the swamp...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You are no match for the Blackrock Orcs!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Watch your step...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Here we go, people.  Watch your backs..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Grrrrr!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Feel the power of the Brotherhood!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ah, a chance to use this freshly sharpened blade."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Yiieeeee! Me run!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,No kill me! No kill me!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I think that's the last of them. It's a good thing you came when you did... I wasn't sure how much longer I could stay hidden.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Say your prayers!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I'll take your money and your life too!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"No one's going to save you now, human!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Thank the Light you're here! Get your sword out, there's centaur on my tail!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The swamp was horrible! I was so... so... scared!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,It was a simple mistake. A wrong turn I tell you!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Blue team, Winner!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Red team, winner!"

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"SMOTTS!  HEY, SMOTTS!!  COME OUT AND PLAY!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,If you touch me again it'll be the last thing you touch!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What? You mean you can't kill this one by yourself?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Just release me already! I've had enough!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Make yourself useful and help me out here!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Why did I have to get stuck with this repulsive, feeble excuse for a warlock?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You better back me up on this one!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,This better be the last one!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Alright I'm going! Stop yelling!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"There, $N.  You may speak now speak to the Bloodscalp chief and his witchdoctor."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Orcs are smarter than those couriers! Where the blazes are they?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Stupidity! I'm surrounded by stupidity!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ah, good $N.  Now let us see what tale these heads tell..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Off to Darkshire then, I suppose."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Thank you, all. I shall return again in about a week."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The time has come for me to once again make my wares available to all who travel near Sentinel Hill! Come one, come all!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Long-lasting, well-crafted items for sale near the Hill! Come one, come all! Time is short, so make haste."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Known throughout the lands, Antonio Perelli's goods now for sale near Sentinel Hill! I must move on soon, so make haste."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Home again, home again."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Good bye, Goldshire. I'll be back soon enough-- perhaps a week's time."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Good people of Goldshire, come take advantage of my incredible prices on rare goods. I shall not return for some time!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Come one, come all! Antonio's wares are for sale. I may not return for a great deal of time, so come one, come all."

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hello again, Antonio. Thank you again for the hat for my wife. She adored it."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You're very welcome! I must be on my way... be safe, all of you."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hello, my friends. It is good to see you again. Still keeping our borders free I see. Antonio appreciates your hard work."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Take care of yourself, Antonio. I'll see you in another week."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Good to see you again, Amy. Be safe, luv. I'm off to Goldshire now."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Items powerful enough to help make the journey through Duskwood, Antonio Perelli's goods are now for sale here in Lakeshire."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I've finally reached Lakeshire-- come one, come all, and take advantage of Antonio Perelli's wonderful deals."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Oops!

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,If you want her back you're gonna have to beg!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What happens when I do this?!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I have your dolly! Nyah nyah!

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hello, hello, Amy. It's good to be back in Lakeshire and to see you, milady."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Stop! You'll pull her head off!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You're hurting her!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Stop pulling her hair out!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I'm telling Mommy!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,WAAAHHH!!!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Don't hurt Betsy, you meanie!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Betsy! Give me Betsy back!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Ha ha! I have Betsy!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Finally, Redridge. A pleasant change from the dark, cold fog of Duskwood."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Farewell, citizens of Darkshire. Until next time..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Leave your battles or errands, and browse my incredible wares! Only in Darkshire for a short time... praise the Light for that."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Well met, travelers of Duskwood! My incredible wares are on sale for a short time in Darkshire. Make haste!"

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Adventurers from all over sell things to Antonio-- come look for yourselves what little treasures he has for you this week.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"This week it could be eye of newt, or perhaps a treasure map. You'll never know unless you look. What could Antonio have?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Items of antiquity, weapons of war, armor or rarity. Who knows what Antonio will be carrying this week if you do not come look."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I hate this part of my job. Oh Duskwood, be gentle with poor Antonio."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,%s's spirit is freed...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Night, night."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Another day gone by...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Mmm, good stuff. Back to work once again."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Little food'll feel pretty good right about now.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,My back is killing me today.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"This bridge isn't ever going to be finished, is it?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Sorry, ah'm late."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Huh?! Darn it, it's lunch time! I overslept!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Night, all. I'm gonna sit up for a bit. Maybe Darcy'll come by."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Oh well, I'm sure she'll be around later."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You guys see her? I didn't see Darcy. I wonder where she is tonight.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You know, this bridge is kind of large for just the 6 of us to be building. You'd think more people would've been hired."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"By the Light, I'm hungry today. Did you all see Darcy today? She looked great."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I love mornings! It's a great day, isn't it? Smell that air?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Ugh! Being on your feet all day is no way to make a living. I should have been a tailor.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Finally! I can't wait to get some sleep tonight.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,'Bout time. I was hungry an hour ago.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Okay, okay... I'm up."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Can't we just sleep a while longer?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Good night, my friends. Until tomorrow."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Another good day indeed.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,*Dimitri wipes sweat from his forehead and lays down his tools*
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Tis a good day to live, neh? Hard work and good food-- there are worse things we could be doing on such a beautiful day."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Ahh... food It's 'bout time.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Morning, my friends."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Good night, gents. Sleep well."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Day's wasting. Let's get going.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Call it a day, men!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Good, good. Keep it up and this bridge'll be done in no time."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Okay, lunch time's over, guys. Let's get back to work. If the rest of the day goes this well, then maybe we'll cut out early."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The bridge is looking great. We keep up this pace and it'll be done for the first expansion forces to head north.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Take a break, men! Half hour and then back to work."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hi Ho, Hi Ho, and all that... let's get a move on."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ya'll get a few minutes to wake up, but let's get started soon."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"All right, you lazy bums, time to get up and get started. That bridge isn't getting built on its own."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You may have succeeded in stopping us this time, but we shall return-- this we assure you!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The Magistrate is too well protected. Retreat!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The meddlers shall pay for their interference. Retreat to the shadows!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Haha! Alterac and Hillsbrad shall come under our rightful rule once again now that the Magistrate has fallen. Retreat!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The Magistrate has fallen! Make your escape, my brothers."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The deed is done! The Magistrate is dead-- to the shadows, my brethren."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The assassins are over here! Quickly, before they reach the Magistrate!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,They're here! They're over here! Help me!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I'm so tired *pant pant*
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Hear ye! Hear ye! *pant pant* Be warned citizens of Southshore: assassins are heading to our fair town!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Greetings Citizens!  Soon perhaps the tide will turn in our favor and the plague will end.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I spent my whole life caring for these trees. Pruning and nurturing them... only fitting that they have joined me in death.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,This orchard is now as barren and lifeless as my rotting shell. Once these trees bloomed with fruit but now there is only rot.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Protect the Magistrate at all costs. They could come from any direction!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Anyone suspicious is to be taken down quickly. Get to your posts as quickly as possible!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Get to your posts! Let no invader reach Southshore!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You're going to pay for this outrage! Guards!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Protect Foreman Bonds at all costs!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Southshore stout, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Revenge shall be mine at last!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I have risen!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Die in the name of the Dark Lady, $n."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I rise from the grave to take my revenge!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Over here! Inside the room. Did you find the key to my chains? The human Borhuin has them.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"My bones are weak, my eyes see only darkness, and my body feels only pain; but these things are good because my will is my own."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Terror, darkness, power? The Forsaken crave not these things; the Forsaken ARE these things."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You are free of His control. And while you will be judged by lesser beings, at least you have chances that the Scourge do not!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Your undeath is not the end of your life, but the beginning. It is up to you to decide where your fate lies now."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,And Shindigger Stout too!  Thank the Light!  I was parched!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Finally they show mercy!  They've given us something to drink!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Croak!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Stay back vile creatures!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The Agamand Mills is held by the Scourge, $C.  Join us!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Thurman my brother, who's laughing now?  Hah!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Mother, oh mother.  You should have listened to me..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Father?  Are you proud of me now? HAHAH!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"My family hates me.  Frightened idiots, all of them!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I'm cold, lord.  When will you keep your promise?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I am the head of the family.  Me.  ME!!!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,They thought I was weak.  Haha!!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,This is a dangerous line of business!$B$BMiran just left with a delivery. He should be back in a few minutes.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Oh, my brothers!  May you find rest in your watery graves!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ah, beautiful Menethil Harbor, with the best mead this side of Ironforge."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Don't mind me, or my smell...because I sure don't!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Curse you, Halyndor!  You led us to our doom!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I'm cursed!  First my ship sinks, and now...I'm out of mead!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Make Way!  Make Way!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,All is lost!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,A $N attacks!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Beware!  A $N is upon us!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,No two-bit traitor will stop the powder from getting to Ironband!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Death and Praise for the Lich King!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"We will drive our foes from Silverpine, then bring the tides of war to their very capital!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"These undead rabble, and their dead-elf queen, will fall!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,We are the arm of His will.  And we will crush His foes into grave dust!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Make ready for battle, my creations."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Prepare yourselves, for we will soon launch an assault against they who called themselves ""The Forsaken."""
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Our Lord commands us to make ready for war!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"We grow strong, while our foes are surrounded by foes, and weakened by constant attacks."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The Dark Lady's followers are blind to think they can stand against our might.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The rebels of Lordaeron are small and weak, and know not the joy of serving our Lich King."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I come with news of our conflict with the Rogue Undead.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The rage burning within you will soon find fuel in our enemies.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Soon, your thirst for destruction will be quenched."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The time for conquest approaches quickly.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,My minions...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"$N, I have the information you seek..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,This is unforseen.  The being who enchanted this is known to me...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Get him!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Send them on! I'm not afraid of some scrawny beasts!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Help! I've only one hand to defend myself with.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I shall spill your blood, $C!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Tilloa is that you?  Why no!  It's just some dirty $r!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Toil not in matters of the past, $N!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Who is this mere $r that meddles with that which is past?  May the legend of Stalvan die along with you!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The Sons of Arugal will rise against all who challenge the power of the Moonrage!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I shall return in time..
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ah, here at last! It's going to feel so good to get rid of these barrels."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,We are under siege!  To arms!  Kill this $N!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,$N coming this way fast!  Prepare for attack!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I smell a $R.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What was that?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,That $N wants me dead!  Help!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,$N coming in fast!  Prepare to fight!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Need a little help here.  That $N saw me.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Die you worthless $N!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I've been spotted!  $N incoming! Help!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"We made it!  Thanks, $N.  I couldn't have gotten here without you."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Let's get to the others, and keep an eye open for those wolves outside..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Here's a singing telegram for $N: Roses are red, violets are blue, I will kill any $R I see, including you!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I have a special message for $N.  And it says you must die!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I'll deliver you, weak $C, to the afterlife!"

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Long live the mighty Blackrock Clan!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Foolish $C!  I will snap the bones of this weak $R!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Tiny $C!  You are no match for the Blackrock Clan!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Who dares intrude upon the Blackrock Clan?  Death to this $R!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Death to $N!  Long live the Blackrock Clan!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I am Gath'Ilzogg!  And you are a $R on the brink of death!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Foolish $C!  You are no match for my might!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Stupid $R!  The Blackrock Clan shall dance on your grave!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Who is this weak $R?  A foul intruder I say.  Die fool!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Die $N!  The only good $C is a dead $C.

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"$N, may your death stand as an example to all who challenge the Defias Brotherhood!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I am Balgaras the Foul.  And you, $N, are about to become nothing more than ash and dust."

Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,$N!  Prepare to meet your doom!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"A worthless $R such as you, $N, has no right to walk these lands!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Foolish $C!  You are no match for the minions of Ragnaros!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The Dark Iron Dwarves shall reclaim their rightful lands!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,$N!  Betrayer of Ragnaros!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The Loch belongs to the Stonesplinter Tribe now, $N!  Now die!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Die, $R!  These lands belong to the Stonesplinter Tribe!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The Stonesplinter Tribe shall see to your doom!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,A $C called $N? You'll make a fine breakfast!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The Stonewrought Dam will be destroyed!  Long live Ragnaros!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Kill the filthy $R!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,All those who betray Ragnaros must die!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What have we here?  $N the $C?  Attack!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,King Magni Bronzebeard is a fool and a charlatan!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The Thandol Span fell to Ragnaros.  So shall the Stonewrought Dam!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Best ale in Stormwind, Langston. Thanks."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Let me have another one, Langston."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You can thank me anytime for making your life more interesting.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Well, you're still here. I'd say that is something worth drinking to."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You are constantly surprising me with what a person can live through.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Never seen anyone move so fast in my whole life.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Let's not even begin comparing battle scars, my friend."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,It all worked out in the end.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You screamed like a little girl, funniest thing I ever saw."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hehe, wimp."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Aye and thanks for letting me carry my own hand back to the priests that night.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Was that the third or fourth time you nearly got me gutted trying one of your crazy stunts?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Course I remember that night. Two inches to the left and you'd be drinking with that elf, Morris. That was my best shirt, too."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I have a piece of iron in my back that will remind me of that night for the rest of my days.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Wasn't that the night we had to pick up my thumb and carry it in your smoke pouch?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I woke up in a bed in Northshire three weeks later. Don't remember a damn thing.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Broke both me legs that night. How could I forget?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I still have the scars from that night.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Ahh the Glustewelt twins!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ahh yes, now I remember, your wedding night wasn't it?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Battling that band of Twilight Hammer in the Morass, I could think of better places for a war."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The best had to have been the look on Perenolde's face when our army comes marchin' right up to his front door. What a battle!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Less than a hundred of us, and over a thousand orcs. Only a handful of us managed to walk away from that one."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I miss the dwarven ale we used to get at that inn in Lordaeron. Remember that fight we started there?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I tell ye, I don't miss the Great War at all. I remember when we fought at Darrowmere. All night in the fog, lying in a muddy trench."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Remember when Danath gathered all the mercenaries of Stormwind together and we marched to fight at Nethergarde?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I'll be a guard someday!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Gimlok, don't you go and get your clothes all dirty."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Where has the boy gotten to now?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Gimlok!  Gimlok! Get in here this instant!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,No one lives forever...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,He really couldn't help it...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Every bodies coming...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Where's the rest of the guys?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Noma should have dinner ready soon. Might as well head in.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I'll drink to anything!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What? Did someone say ale? Don't start pouring the pints without ol' Torren!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Here! Here! I'll drink to that!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Mmmmm, an ale by the fire does sound good. Sure, I will join ya Jern."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Brock. Torren. I am going inside for an ale and to warm myself by the fire.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Nothing like a roaring fire on a cool night with good friends and dwarven ale.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Gettin' a bit nippy out here. Think I will go warm myself by the fire and grab a pint or twelve.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Thanks Mrs. Brightbeard!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Wheeee! Thanks Mom!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The kids jump up and down with youthful energy. (PH emote)
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Mom! Can we go play please please please? Can we huh? Can we?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Let none with the foul taint of plague live!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The Scarlet Crusade will scour these lands!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Keep up the good work.  This scourge will be cleansed!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,We must be vigilant to eradicate this plague!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Ok...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Awww Mom! It's hardly dark yet! Can we play for a bit longer please?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Oh, shut up."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"They have you good on that one, lad!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hah! Daryl, you should have seen the look on your face! You half jumped out of your skin!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Alright, alright. You two can go play just stay in town. No sneaking off to bug Warg and Khara down by the water."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You can play more tomorrow. Now come on inside.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Berte! Evalyn! It's getting dark. Come inside.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hmph! What a sorry day for fishin' this is going to be. Ah well, a bad day fishin' is better then a good day workin'."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Not looking too good today. Sun is high and bright early and no activity on the water.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hmmmm, only a little bit of activity on the surface but the sun is in the right place. Might turn out to be a fine day."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Look at all those ripples. Lots of activity in the water so I should catch a mess of fish today.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Best be on my way. Khara will be expecting me soon. See ya tomorrow X.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Welp the fish ain't bitin' no more so I might as start gutting and cleaning what I did catch today.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Warg looks over the water appraising what his luck might be today.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What a day for fishin'. They are sure to be bitin' today!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Another glorious day of fishin' is ahead of me, Khara. I best get movin'."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Thanks for the great meal darlin' but I need to get back out front.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Whew! I think I ate too much. Need to loosen my belt a few notches.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Burp! Hon, that was really good. Not only do you know how to catch a fish but you sure do know how to cook one."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,MMmmMMmmm. Smells delicious Khara.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ahhh, just in time! My stomach was rumblin' loud."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Mmmm, that was good. However, time to get back to work!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hon, food is ready. Come wash up and eat."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Khara hums an old dwarven tune while she cooks.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Warg, are you about ready to eat? I am gonna get it started."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Only $3658E shopping minutes before Christmas!  But wait, is it Christmas?  Well then, there are only $3659E minutes left to party!  TEST TEST DO NOT LOCALIZE"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Bullseye! That blasted dwarf doesn't know what he is talking about. Only thing wrong with Grumlar's gun is Grumlar's aim.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Almost perfect shot! It's a bit off but I can see where Grumlar would miss with it. He couldn't hit the broad side of a barn.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hmmmm... That one clipped it's shoulder. Grumlar was right, the sights are slightly off. Easy enough for me to fix though."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Hmph! I didn't even hit the blasted target! That thick skulled dwarf was probably using the gun as a mace again.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Vrok said the sights are off on Grumlar's gun. I suppose I should check it.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,We really should fix this fence soon.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,*sigh* It's about time to check on the cemetery again-- I'll be back in a few minutes.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Watch your step out there.  Many an adventure seeker has not returned from the marsh.  hic!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I'd go out and clear out some of those gnolls, but this leg has seen better days and I am afraid I'd just wind up dead."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I saw a Sea Giant once.  It's not something I would care to see again.  Burp!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Stormy seas out there.  The sea spirits must be restless....hic!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The Scarlet Crusade shall not fail in its mission!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,These undead atrocities will be destroyed!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Get in position lads! The beasties are upon us. Wait for my signal!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Attack!!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,PICK ME!!!!!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"This will take a while to heat up, so its time for a drink! What do you say Tongus?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,See what I mean?  Get inside right now.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You get down from there right now!  I don't want you climbing that thing.  It's not safe.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Whoa...Whoa..Aaaaahhh!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I can't come down.  I am scared.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You'd better not tattle on me!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Mom, Jesse climbed the wind tower again."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I made it to the last waypoint.  Yay!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I'm moving within the building
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I'm out of the building again.  Now I'll move one more waypoint...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Testing 3
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Testing 2
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Testing 1
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I should get back before Rema starts to worry...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Thank you kindly!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Take care, and send our regards to your family."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"See you later, Corbett, and tell the missus hello!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hi Corbett!  Here, you go!  I trust business is faring well at your clothier shop...?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Good day, Elling!  Hullo Elaine!  Let me have a wheel of bleu cheese, eh?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Mom said not to climb up there any more.  I'm gonna tell!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Hey! You better not have gone too far!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,...Nine...Ten...Ready or not.  Here I come!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,DARKSHIRE...I HUNGER!!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Yes, commander!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"This doesn't bode well.  Send scouts to gather more intelligence, and stay on alert."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Althea, there are reports of strange happenings at the graveyard.  Ello believes it portends an attack on Darkshire."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Watcher, inform Althea that a dire threat is marshalling against our town.  We must prepare!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"This is grim news, and I fear it is linked to the dealings $N had with the Embalmer."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Yes, Lord Mayor."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Wolves head this way, as if fleeing from...something."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Hideous bellows and growls are heard coming from that old hermit's shack!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Mayor Ello!  Our graveyard scouts return with ominous reports...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Lord Mayor!  Our scouts report strange activity to the west.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Well, I'm off then.  Take care, Harlan."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ah, much appreciated, Corbett.  We'll get these on the racks immediately."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Oomph!  Here's another load of supplies, Harlan.  It must be selling fast!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I should have a few extra coins from this sale.  Maybe I'll buy myself some lunch...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Business must be good down at the bazaar.  I'll get him resupplied right away!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Corbett, you there?  Harlan needs another load of knitted goods.  Can you take it to him?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Maybe, but if it did hit me upside the head I'd know exactly which cannon to use to blow it into the smallest bits!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Bah! You wouldn't know a great steam engine if it smacked you upside the head!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Ha! I'd take the sound of a Crater Cannon XT blasting off a shell over that any day!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Nothing beats the sound of a twin-carb, fork-ring steam engine burning pure firestone!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Haha! Sturdy old Trollplow has just a few meager battle scars!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Ha! I'm more afraid that those old holes and gashes would burst that thing and I would be showered by the shrapnel!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Har! You scared I'll hurt your little dainty racer?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Nothing you can say will ever get me in the arena against that monstrosity of a machine you call a steam tank!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Aye sure, just as long as we get to hit the arena right after!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hey Stone, let's hit the circuit some time. We could run a few laps and see who wins?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Bah! That's no fun!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I would have just dropped some Evershine in my tank and been back home before they realized I'd gone!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Brahaha! Tha look on their faces as old Trollplow's gun came swiveling around to meet them! Their saws couldn't even touch me!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ah, let me see. Yes probably nearing a hundred times now I'd wager!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hey Fizzer, I ever tell you the time I was riding through the canals and some goblins in shredder suits tried to ambush me?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Argh! You're hopeless!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Bah! By the time you got in range of old Trollplow you would be in reduced to rubble!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Do you ever think about anything other than fighting? I could circle you down on the stretch course!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Ah yes. I've heard all about those new flarged things. Armor was removed from the casing to decrease weight. Bargh! Nonsense!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hey Stone, did you hear about the new steam engine old Tonkrend has been runnin on?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Alright, we're getting close to the excavation site, so we have to proceed carefully. Engage underwater breathing apparatus..."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Alright, we've just gotten word that a caravan is leaving from Thelsamar. It's time to move! Go go go!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Thank you, Keldric. See you later."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Here's my list, Keldric. The usual stuff."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I suppose you're right.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Only if we didn't follow the proper initialization procedures.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,At least we wouldn't be around to have to clean it up.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"If we use the Surian theory, then yes, but not if we go with the Y'serian approach."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Wow, all of this for a love potion. Hope he's worth it."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,If we use the appropriate sequence we should be ok. Will just take some serious studying before we start.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Always so negative. The chances of that happening are between zero and none.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,But if we stabilize it with an anchor thread at the appropriate energy crux then it should work.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What if we used three focuses in Tyrean pattern? That should solve it.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I suppose that could work, if we had twenty people to cast it with."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"That will unbalance the magical focus, though, and cause a reverse vibration in the ether."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I think not, I don't need to be blown up again."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,But isn't that what caused the initial problems with Adept Syleria's magical formulae?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The resultant energies could collapse though, and that could cause an energy flux that would give you a migraine for weeks."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,But wouldn't that mean crossing the streams? Isn't that really bad?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Wouldn't that cause the weave to unravel if not properly anchored before starting the casting?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,But what if the resulting frequency shift were to send magical feedback up the flows?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Putting in twelve centers of focus might allow the magical energies to form more solidly, adding the necessary stability."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Why can't we just shift the array to compensate for the variance in the flux?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The magical wards at that point should be supported enough by the energy flux to contain the entity.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Maginor says that twisting alternating flows of positive energy actually creates a much more stable flow.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"When the positively aligned energies collide with the negatively charged energies, they don't negate one another."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The portal will shift slightly, at this point if you cast a binding cantrip you will solidify it in place."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,So then the array of magics would cascade into a chain reaction of positively charged energies.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,If we reverse the Essence flows perhaps we can alter the polarity.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Thanks for the cask of booze, $N.  I think I'll open up a bottle right now!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Three cheers for $N!  This land shall be ours once again!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The People of Westfall salute $N, a brave and valiant defender of freedom."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I'm sure it's just incompetence or oversight by some of the workers.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Dark Iron activity. Even that some of the shipments have been hijacked--
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Sorry, Huldar... But it seems I've misled you."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I heard all the kobolds that were down there are dead.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Guard duty, I hate guard duty."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You hear that? I think they're getting closer...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"It's all their fault, stupid orcs. Had to burn my farm to the ground."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"It's all their fault, stupid Alliance army. Just had to build their towers right behind my farm."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Shine yer armor for a copper.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Spare some change for a poor blind man? ...What do you mean I'm not blind? ...I'M NOT BLIND! I CAN SEE!! It's a miracle!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Help a poor bloke out?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Alms for the poor?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Could ye spare some coin?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Worm goes on the hook, hook goes in the water. Fish is in the water, our fish."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I don't think there's any fish in these canals.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I hope that was a fish!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Something smells funny.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I got worm guts on my shoes.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Eww... that's not a fish!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I think I see something.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I thought I heard something.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Sounds kinda like one of Billy's fish stories to me.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Can you imagine?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,My father says that's just a story.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,That's neat.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Oh c'mon, that's not true."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Don't make me get my pappy to catch you! He likes to catch bunnies using his rifle!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Carrots every day for a year if you stop!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Fluffy! Fluffy stop running!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,C'mon Fluffy! I just want to give you a bath!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Why do you run from me Fluffy!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Come back Fluffy!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Oh yeah, I heard about that."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Wow.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You know there are crocilisks in the Canals. They were brought from the swamp as pets, but got thrown in the canals."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,And then the rabbit just bit his head off... I swear.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I swear, people have actually seen them. Pandaren really do exist!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,There is no spoon.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You know why orc eyes glow red? It's because they drink blood!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,They say he can turn into a raven sometimes.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,And so the knights stood before the charging Horde and held their ground as a thousand berserk orcs came through the valley.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,And that's how Lothar killed thirty six orcs with his bare hands!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Really?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Maybe we should go to the bridge and fish.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,If you could catch a fish big enough for your mouth we'd never be hungry again.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,You're making that up.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Shhh! You're scaring the fish away.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,If you fished as well as you talked the ocean wouldn't have any fish left.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I heard a story about this golden fish, and if you caught it you would get three wishes!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"And one time, at camp, I caught a fish that was bigger than I am!!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I heard that there are these huge fish that can walk on land to hunt, and eat people!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Liar!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Nuh uh.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Look! Look! I caught something! Aww....it's just a stinky ol' boot.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,My daddy can catch more fish than your daddy!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"My daddy says that in the ocean, there are fish so big they could swallow a whole ship."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"I caught a big one last week, it had three eyes!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Think there are any fish in here?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I'm now far enough away...so I can't see the barrel.  Poison away!.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I'm back where I started.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Well, back to business for me.  But it sure was nice taking that short break, and it's always nice drinking Thunder Ale!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Hoha! I'd welcome the challenge from old weakbelly!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Belm says pay your bill or he'll break your face.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Aye, tell your friend there Tongus if he dont take care of his tab here, i'll be making an appearance with old Steelhead!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Aye there you go lad, your favorite brew."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Bagh! Back to work for me! Thank you kindly Belm.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ach! Toss me a cold frosty, Belm!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Ah I am too busy for a drink now lad.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Looks like I need more practice!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Let's see if I can hit that bullseye this time.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,What is going on here?  Leave that powder alone!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,It'll take more than a rotting corpse to stop us!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Who goes there?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,$N!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You've ruined your own lands, you'll not ruin mine."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Where's My Bacon?
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"That's right, we're stupid. Stupid like a Fox!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Fine! You've outreasoned me, you masters of Engineering! Put the door wherever you want!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I didn't know he was getting married! I didn't even know he was dating! That's terrible! He can't work nights anymore!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The abomination has come! Forward!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"It isn't enough! Defenders, gather in the center of town. Together we will stand against the undead monster!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Oh my!  Look at the state of these books!  Who put them back without alphabetizing them??
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Now where was that book on Night Elf customs I was looking for...
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"So much to do, so much to do!  Where does the time go?"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Welcome to the Lion's Pride Inn.  Make yourself at home!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Welcome to the Scarlet Raven.  It's best to stay indoors these days.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Step right up and wet your whistle.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,There is something greater than magic at work in the night sky.  One day they'll listen to me. . . .
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The spirits whisper in my ear.  They are restless and full of angst.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The future holds much death and uncertainty, not unlike the past."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The stars speak to me.  They whisper of the horrors waiting in the night.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I sense evil brewing. . . .
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Our cause falls on deaf ears beyond the thick, stone walls of Stormwind."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The people of Darkshire expect more from the Council.  We cannot let them suffer from this unholy wrath which plagues us.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The Council of Duskwood must take action.  Evil lingers in the air.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The forest is crawling with Worgen and Ghouls.  Something must be done!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,We must not give into the evil which has darkened our land.  The Night Watch must prevail!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The Night Watch alone cannot protect us forever.  We need the backing of the Stormwind Army.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Fear not.  The Night Watch will rid the land of this foul taint soon enough.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"They might have run all the other farmers off, but the Saldean's will never leave Westfall."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,A bunch of thugs and thieves aren't going to get me to leave my land!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,We'll be out of here just as soon as I get this wagon fixed. . . .
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I never thought the day would come that I'd leave my homeland of Westfall. . . .
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Marshal Marris expects the reserve from Stormwind any time now. . . .
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Still no sign of the 2nd Battalion from Stormwind.  Reports are coming in of Shadowhide movement in the Northeast.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Come on boys, we've got to get this bridge rebuilt."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Hopefully the reinforcements from Stormwind show up soon. . . .
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The bottles are dusty but the liquor goes down clean!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Here fishy fishy. . . come to papa.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Stormwind's desertion shall not be forgiven by the people of Westfall.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"All clear on Sentinel Hill, Lord Stoutmantle.  Heavy Defias movement reported in Moonbrook, however."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The farms must be liberated.  Stormwind may have deserted these people, but I'll be damned if I will."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Everywhere I look I see thieves.  We, The People's Miltia, must return this land to the farmers."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,I'm here for the gold.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Come one! Come all! Perelli's elixirs will dazzle!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Antonio Perelli's miracle elixirs for sale!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Brave $c, thank you for rescuing me! I am sure Marshal Marris will reward your kind deed, $N."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"The Blackrock infestation is thick in these parts.  I will do my best to keep the pace, $N.  Let's go!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Ah, fresh air at last! I need a moment to rest, $N."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"$n, my wounds are grave.  Forgive my slow pace but my injuries won't allow me to walk any faster."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Another herd brought in successfully!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Hey, follow me!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"All right, you guys! Time to get up"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"All right people, look alive!"
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Good for nothing Kobolds!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Grrrr! Idiots!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Work scum!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"You can go tell Stoutmantle this is where the Defias Gang is holed up, $N."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,The entrance is hidden here in Moonbrook.  Keep your eyes peeled for thieves.  They want me dead.
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Follow me, $N. I'll take you to the Defias hideout. But you better protect me or I am as good as dead."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Thank you very much!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,"Come, let us engage in fisticuffs, like civilized folk."
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Forward.. MARCH!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Company.. HALT!  ... Fall IN!
Unknown_broadcast,,gossip,,Help help!  I'm being repressed!
